Tumor-educated B cells selectively promote breast cancer lymph node metastasis by HSPA4-targeting IgG,30643287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30643287,"Primary tumors may create the premetastatic niche in secondary organs for subsequent metastasis. Humoral immunity contributes to the progression of certain cancers, but the roles of B cells and their derived antibodies in premetastatic niche formation are poorly defined. Using a mouse model of spontaneous lymph node metastasis of breast cancer, we show that primary tumors induced B cell accumulation in draining lymph nodes. These B cells selectively promoted lymph node metastasis by producing pathogenic IgG that targeted glycosylated membrane protein HSPA4, and activated the HSPA4-binding protein ITGB5 and the downstream Src/NF-κB pathway in tumor cells for CXCR4/SDF1α-axis-mediated metastasis. High serum anti-HSPA4 IgG was correlated with high tumor HSPA4 expression and poor prognosis of breast cancer subjects. Our findings identify a key role for tumor-educated B cells and their derived antibodies in lymph node premetastatic niche formation, providing potential targets for cancer intervention."
HSPA4 upregulation induces immune evasion via ALKBH5/CD58 axis in gastric cancer,38589927,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38589927,"Introduction:
        

      
      Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Recently, targeted therapies including PD1 (programmed cell death 1) antibodies have been used in advanced GC patients. However, identifying new biomarker for immunotherapy is still urgently needed. The objective of this study is to unveil the immune evasion mechanism of GC cells and identify new biomarkers for immune checkpoint blockade therapy in patients with GC.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Coimmunoprecipitation and meRIP were performed to investigate the mechanism of immune evasion of GC cells. Cocuture system was established to evaluate the cytotoxicity of cocultured CD8
+
 T cells. The clinical significance of HSPA4 upregulation was analyzed by multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry staining in GC tumor tissues.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Histone acetylation causes HSPA4 upregulation in GC tumor tissues. HSPA4 upregulation increases the protein stability of m
6
A demethylase ALKBH5. ALKBH5 decreases CD58 in GC cells through m
6
A methylation regulation. The cytotoxicity of CD8
+
 T cells are impaired and PD1/PDL1 axis is activated when CD8
+
 T cells are cocultured with HSPA4 overexpressed GC cells. HSPA4 upregulation is associated with worse 5-year overall survival of GC patients receiving only surgery. It is an independent prognosis factor for worse survival of GC patients. In GC patients receiving the combined chemotherapy with anti-PD1 immunotherapy, HSPA4 upregulation is observed in responders compared with non-responders.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      HSPA4 upregulation causes the decrease of CD58 in GC cells via HSPA4/ALKBH5/CD58 axis, followed by PD1/PDL1 activation and impairment of CD8
+
 T cell's cytotoxicity, finally induces immune evasion of GC cells. HSPA4 upregulation is associated with worse overall survival of GC patients with only surgery. Meanwhile, HSPA4 upregulation predicts for better response in GC patients receiving the combined immunotherapy."
HSPA4 Knockdown Retarded Progression and Development of Colorectal Cancer,34163243,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34163243,"Purpose:
        

      
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy associated with high morbidity and mortality. Heat shock 70 kDa protein 4 (HSPA4) has been shown to exert regulatory roles during tumor progression in different cancer types. Here, we investigated the expression and cellular functions of HSPA4 in CRC.
    





          Materials and methods:
        

      
      Expression of HSPA4 in CRC tissues and paracancerous tissues was analyzed by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry IHC staining. The functional roles of HSPA4 were explored using shRNA-mediated knockdown in HCT116 and RKO CRC cell lines, both in vitro and in tumor xenograft studies.
    





          Results:
        

      
      HSPA4 expression was significantly increased at the RNA and protein levels in CRC tissues compared with noncancerous tissues. Moreover, HSPA4 expression was positively associated with tumor stage and its high expression of HSPA4 indicated poor patient prognosis. In vitro studies established that HSPA4 knockdown inhibited proliferation and migration, causing arrest in the G2-phase of the cell cycle along with increased levels of apoptosis. This phenotype was recapitulated in vivo where HSPA4 knockdown suppressed xenograft growth. Mechanistic investigations showed silencing of HSPA4 reduced activation of the PI3K, Akt signaling axis while also downregulating the cell cycle progression markers, CCND1 and CDK6. Similarly, there was altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins consistent with the increase in apoptosis.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      Our findings demonstrate clinical significance for HSPA4 in CRC, further showing that HSPA4 contributes to CRC tumorigenesis through effects on proliferation, migration and survival. Thus, HSPA4 represents a novel prognostic indicator as well as a promising therapeutic target in CRC."

Significant correlation between HSPA4 and prognosis and immune regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma,34754620,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34754620,"Background:
        

      
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an inflammation-associated tumor involved in immune tolerance and evasion in the immune microenvironment. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are involved in the occurrence, progression, and immune regulation of tumors. Therefore, HSPs have been considered potential therapeutic targets. Here, we aimed to elucidate the value of HSP family A (Hsp70) member 4 (HSPA4) in the diagnosis and predicting prognosis of HCC, and its relationship with immune cell infiltration, immune cell biomarkers, and immune checkpoints. Gene mutation, DNA methylation, and the pathway involved in HCC were also analyzed.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      The gene expression omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were used to compare HSPA4 expression, and the results were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of clinical samples. R package was used to analyze the correlation between HSPA4 and cancer stage, and to establish receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of diagnosis, time-dependent survival ROC curve, and a nomogram model. cBioPortal and MethSurv were used to identify genetic alterations and DNA methylation, and their effect on prognosis. The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) was used to analyze immune cell infiltration, immune cell biomarkers, and immune checkpoints. The STRING database was used to analyze protein-protein interaction network information. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to investigate the functions of HSPA4 and its functional partner genes.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Overexpression of HSPA4 was identified in 25 cancers. Overexpression of HSPA4 considerably correlated with cancer stage and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in HCC. Patients with higher HSPA4 expression showed poorer prognosis. HSPA4 expression can accurately identify tumor from normal tissue (AUC = 0.957). The area under 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival ROCs were above 0.6. The HSPA4 genetic alteration rate was 1.3%. Among the 14 DNA methylation CpG sites, seven were related to the prognosis of HCC. HSPA4 was positively related to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoints (PD-1 and CTLA-4) in HCC. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed HSPA4 enrichment in antigen processing and presentation together with HSPA8 and HSP90AA1. We verified the value of HSPA4 in the diagnosis and predicting prognosis of HCC. HSPA4 may not only participate in the occurrence and progression but also the immune regulation of HCC. Therefore, HSPA4 can be a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for HCC."
HSPA4 regulated glioma progression via activation of AKT signaling pathway,37339521,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37339521,"Glioma is still an incurable disease with high invasiveness. Heat shock 70 kDa protein 4 (HSPA4) is a member of the HSP110 family, and is associated with the development and progression of various cancers. In the current study, we assessed the expression of HSPA4 in clinical samples, and found that HSPA4 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and correlated with tumor recurrence and grade. Survival analyses demonstrated that glioma patients with high HSPA4 expression had lower overall survival and disease-free survival times. In vitro knockdown of HSPA4 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, mediated cell cycle arrest at G2 phase and apoptosis, and reduced the migration ability. In vivo, the growth of HSPA4-knockdown xenografts was markedly suppressed compared to the tumors formed by HSPA4-positive control cells. Additionally, Gene set enrichment analyses disclosed that HSPA4 was associated with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The regulatory effect of the AKT activator SC79 on cell proliferation and apoptosis was suppressed by HSPA4 knockdown, indicating that HSPA4 is capable of promoting glioma development. In summary, these data showed that HSPA4 is likely to play a pivotal role in the progression of glioma, and consequently may be a promising therapeutic target for glioma therapy."
HSPA4 Is a Biomarker of Placenta Accreta and Enhances the Angiogenesis Ability of Vessel Endothelial Cells,35628491,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35628491,"Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) accounts for 7% of maternal mortality and is associated with intraoperative and postoperative morbidity caused by massive blood loss, infection, and adjacent organ damage. The aims of this study were to identify the protein biomarkers of PAS and to further explore their pathogenetic roles in PAS. For this purpose, we collected five placentas from pregnant subjects with PAS complications and another five placentas from normal pregnancy (NP) cases. Then, we enriched protein samples by specifically isolating the trophoblast villous, deeply invading into the uterine muscle layer in the PAS patients. Next, fluorescence-based two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and MALDI-TOF/MS were used to identify the proteins differentially abundant between PAS and NP placenta tissues. As a result, nineteen spots were determined as differentially abundant proteins, ten and nine of which were more abundant in PAS and NP placenta tissues, respectively. Then, specific validation with western blot assay and immunohisto/cytochemistry (IHC) assay confirmed that heat shock 70 kDa protein 4 (HSPA4) and chorionic somatomammotropin hormone (CSH) were PAS protein biomarkers. Further tube formation assays demonstrated that HSPA4 promoted the in vitro angiogenesis ability of vessel endothelial cells, which is consistent with the in vivo scenario of PAS complications. In this study, we not only identified PAS protein biomarkers but also connected the promoted angiogenesis with placenta invasion, investigating the pathogenetic mechanism of PAS."
SIRT1 attenuates neuroinflammation by deacetylating HSPA4 in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease,35158021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35158021,"As a deacetylase, SIRT1 plays essential roles in various physiological events, from development to lifespan regulation. SIRT1 has been shown neuroprotective effects in neurodegeneration disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not well understood. Here, we generated transgenic mice with increased expression of Sirt1 in the brain and examined the potential roles of SIRT1 in PD. Our data showed that SIRT1 repressed proinflammatory cytokine expression both in microglia and astrocytes. In MPTP induced PD model mice, lower levels of microglia and astrocyte activation were observed in SIRT1 transgenic mice. Moreover, the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum induced by MPTP was also attenuated by SIRT1. As a consequence, the behavioral defects induced by MPTP were largely prevented in SIRT1 transgenic mice. Mechanistically, SIRT1 interacts with heat shock 70 kDa protein 4 (HSPA4) and deacetylates it at 305, 351 and 605 lysine residues. This deacetylation modification induces the nuclear translocation of HSPA4 and thus to repress proinflammatory cytokine expression. On the contrary, mutated HSPA4, in which 305/351/605 lysine residues were replaced with arginine, was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and losses its repression on proinflammatory cytokine expression. Taken together, our data indicate that SIRT1 plays beneficial roles in PD model mice, which is likely due to, at least in part, its anti-inflammation activity in glial cells by deacetylating HSPA4. Furthermore, HSPA4 might be a druggable target for developing novel agents for treating neuroinflammation associated disorders such as PD."
Respiratory distress and early neonatal lethality in Hspa4l/Hspa4 double-mutant mice,23980576,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23980576,"Heat shock proteins HSPA4L and HSPA4 are closely related members of the HSP110 family and act as cochaperones. We generated Hspa4l(-/-)Hspa4(-/-) mice to investigate a functional complementarity between HSPA4L and HSPA4 during embryonic development. Hspa4l(-/-)Hspa4(-/-) embryos exhibited marked pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal death. Compared with lungs of wild-type, Hspa4l(-/-), and Hspa4(-/-) embryos, Hspa4l(-/-)Hspa4(-/-) lungs were characterized by diminished saccular spaces and increased mesenchymal septa. Mesenchymal hypercellularity was determined to be due to an increased cell proliferation index and decreased cell death. A significant increase in expression levels of prosurvival protein B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 may be the cause for inhibition of apoptotic process in lungs of Hspa4(-/-)Hspa4l(-/-) embryos. Accumulation of glycogen and diminished expression of surfactant protein B, prosurfactant protein C, and aquaporin 5 in saccular epithelium suggested impaired maturation of type II and type I pneumocytes in the Hspa4l(-/-)Hspa4(-/-) lungs. Further experiments showed a significant accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the lungs of Hspa4l(-/-)Hspa4(-/-) embryos, indicating an impaired chaperone activity. Our study demonstrates that HSPA4L and HSPA4 collaborate in embryonic lung maturation, which is necessary for adaptation to air breathing at birth."
Heat-shock protein HSPA4 is required for progression of spermatogenesis,21487003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21487003,"Heat-shock protein 110 (HSP110) family members act as nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) of mammalian and yeast HSP70 chaperones during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. In this study, we describe the expression pattern of murine HSPA4, a member of the HSP110 family, during testis development and the consequence of HSPA4 deficiency on male fertility. HSPA4 is ubiquitously expressed in all the examined tissues. During prenatal and postnatal development of gonad, HSPA4 is expressed in both somatic and germ cells; however, expression was much higher in germ cells of prenatal gonads. Analyses of Hspa4-deficient mice revealed that all homozygous mice on the hybrid C57BL/6J×129/Sv genetic background were apparently healthy. Although HSPA4 is expressed as early as E13.5 in male gonad, a lack of histological differences between Hspa4(-/-) and control littermates suggests that Hspa4 deficiency does not impair the gonocytes or their development to spermatogonia. Remarkably, an increased number of the Hspa4-deficient males displayed impaired fertility, whereas females were fertile. The total number of spermatozoa and their motility were drastically reduced in infertile Hspa4-deficient mice compared with wild-type littermates. The majority of pachytene spermatocytes in the juvenile Hspa4(-/-) mice failed to complete the first meiotic prophase and became apoptotic. Furthermore, down-regulation of transcription levels of genes known to be expressed in spermatocytes at late stages of prophase I and post-meiotic spermatids leads to suggest that the development of most spermatogenic cells is arrested at late stages of meiotic prophase I. These results provide evidence that HSPA4 is required for normal spermatogenesis."
Targeted disruption of Hspa4 gene leads to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis,22884543,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22884543,"Failure of molecular chaperones to direct the correct folding of newly synthesized proteins leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in cells. HSPA4 is a member of the heat shock protein 110 family (HSP110) that acts as a nucleotide exchange factor of HSP70 chaperones. We found that the expression of HSPA4 is upregulated in murine hearts subjected to pressure overload and in failing human hearts. To investigate the cardiac function of HSPA4, Hspa4 knockout (KO) mice were generated and exhibited cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Hspa4 KO hearts were characterized by a significant increase in heart weight/body weight ratio, elevated expression of hypertrophic and fibrotic gene markers, and concentric hypertrophy with preserved contractile function. In response to pressure overload, cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling were further aggravated in the Hspa4 KO compared to wild type (WT) mice. Cardiac hypertrophy in Hspa4 KO hearts was associated with enhanced activation of gp130-STAT3, CaMKII, and calcineurin-NFAT signaling. Protein blot and immunofluorescent analyses showed a significant accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in cardiac cells of Hspa4 KO mice. These results suggest that the myocardial remodeling of Hspa4 KO mice is due to accumulation of misfolded proteins resulting from impaired chaperone activity. Further analyses revealed a significant increase in cross sectional area of cardiomyocytes, and in expression levels of hypertrophic markers in cultured neonatal Hspa4 KO cardiomyocytes suggesting that the hypertrophy of mutant mice was a result of primary defects in cardiomyocytes. Gene expression profile in hearts of 3.5-week-old mice revealed a differentially expressed gene sets related to ion channels, muscle-specific contractile proteins and stress response. Taken together, our in vivo data demonstrate that Hspa4 gene ablation results in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, possibly, through its role in protein quality control mechanism."
Hspa4 (HSP70) is involved in the radioadaptive response: results from mouse splenocytes,12005543,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12005543,"In a continuation of our earlier study on the involvement of HSP25 (now known as Hspb1) and HSP70 (now known as Hspa4) in the induction of an adaptive response, we examined the involvement of these proteins in the induction of the adaptive response using an animal model system. C57BL6 mice were irradiated with 5 cGy of gamma radiation three times in 1 week (for a total of 15 cGy), and a high challenge dose (6 Gy) was given on the day after the last low-dose irradiation. The survival time of the low-dose preirradiated mice was increased to 30%. The induction of apoptosis induced by 6 Gy was also reduced by this low-dose preirradiation regimen. To elucidate any link existing between the HSPs and the induction of the adaptive response, reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed using splenocytes. High-dose radiation up-regulated the expression of Hspb1 and especially Hspa4, while expression of other HSPs such as HSC70 (now know as Hspa8), Hsp90, and alphaB-crystalline (now known as Cryab) did not change. When splenocytes from Hspa4 transgenic mice were preirradiated with a low dose of radiation, a reduction in cell death after high-dose irradiation was observed. These results suggest that Hspa4 is a key molecule in the induction of the adaptive response."
Frameshift Mutations of HSPA4 and MED13 in Gastric and Colorectal Cancers,27129500,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27129500,"Frameshift mutation of genes containing mononucleotide repeats is a feature of gastric (GC) and colorectal cancers (CRC) with microsatellite instability (MSI). In the public genome database, we found that human HSPA4 gene encoding a heats hock protein 70 protein (HSP70-4) and MED13 gene had mononucleotide repeats in the coding sequences that could be targets for frameshift mutation in cancers with MSI. HSP70-4 is a member of HSP70 that is known to play a role in cell survival. MED13 is a member of MED genome-wide transcription regulators that function as a regulator for diverse biological processes. In this study, we analyzed the mutations in 79 GCs and 124 CRCs including high MSI (MSI-H) and microsatellite stable/low MSI (MSS/MSI-L) cases by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. We found frameshift mutations of HSPA4 gene in two cancers (one GC and one CRC) and MED13 gene in the other two cancers (one GC and one CRC). The frameshift mutations were deletions of one base (c.2396delA (p.Asn799MetfsX50)) in HSPA4 and (c.2175delA (p.Lys725AsnfsX4)) in MED13. Each of HSPA4 and MED13 mutations were detected in GC with MSI-H (1/34: 2.9 %) and CRC with MSI-H (1/79: 1.3 %), but not in those with MSS. Our data show that unconventional HSPA4 and MED13 genes harbored frameshift mutations in GC and CRC with MSI. These mutations might possibly inactivate their functions and could be a feature of GC and CRC with MSI-H."
Retracted: Inhibition of DNAJC12 Inhibited Tumorigenesis of Rectal Cancer via Downregulating HSPA4 Expression,37565223,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37565223,[This retracts the article DOI: 10.1155/2022/1027895.].
Inhibition of DNAJC12 Inhibited Tumorigenesis of Rectal Cancer via Downregulating HSPA4 Expression,36185081,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36185081,"Background:
        

      
      Dysregulation of DnaJ heat shock protein family (HSP40) member C12 (DNAJC12) is implicated in the malignancy progression of multiple cancers. The current study aimed to determine the biology function and mechanism of DNAJC12 in rectal cancer (RC).
    





          Methods:
        

      
      RC tissues, adjacent tissues, RC cell lines, and normal colorectal epithelial cell lines were collected to analyze DNAJC12 expression. The abilities of DNAJC12 on proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of RC cells were detected by CCK-8, wound healing, and flow cytometry assays. Co-IP assays were carried out to confirm the association between DNAJC12 and HSPA4. The effect of DNAJC12 on tumor growth was detected by using the xenograft model of nude mice.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Elevation of DNAJC12 was uncovered in RC tissues and cell lines. DNAJC12 upregulation facilitated RC cell proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis, while DNAJC12 interference showed the opposite results. Besides, HSAP4 served as a potential binding protein for DNAJC12. Rescue experiments revealed that elevated of HSAP4 restored the impact of DNAJC12 silencing on the cell functions. Finally, DNAJC12 silencing hampered tumor growth of RC in vivo.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      In summary, this study highlighted a key player of DNAJC12 in modulating the malignant biological progression of RC via DNAJC12/HSPA4 axis, displaying a potential therapeutic target for RC."
"Unveiling the potential of HSPA4: a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of HSPA4 in diagnosis, prognosis, and immunotherapy",38305786,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38305786,"With the global rise in cancer incidence and mortality rates, research on the topic has become increasingly urgent. Among the significant players in this field are heat shock proteins (HSPs), particularly HSPA4 from the HSP70 subfamily, which has recently garnered considerable interest for its role in cancer progression. However, despite numerous studies on HSPA4 in specific cancer types, a comprehensive analysis across all cancer types is lacking. This study employs various bioinformatics techniques to delve into the role of HSPA4 in pan-cancer. Our objective is to assess its potential in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and as a future molecular target for therapy. The research findings reveal significant differences in HSPA4 expression across different cancer types, suggesting its diagnostic value and close association with cancer staging and patient survival rates. Furthermore, genetic variations and methylation status of HSPA4 play critical roles in tumorigenesis. Lastly, the interaction of HSPA4 with immune cells is linked to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and immunotherapy. In summary, HSPA4 emerges as a promising cancer biomarker and a vital member of the HSPs family, holding potential applications in diagnosis, prognosis, and immunotherapy."
PANoptosis signaling enables broad immune response in psoriasis: From pathogenesis to new therapeutic strategies,38125299,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38125299,"Background:
        

      
      Accumulating evidence suggests that regulated cell death, such as pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. As a newly recognized form of systematic cell death, PANoptosis is involved in a variety of inflammatory disorders through amplifying inflammatory and immune cascades, but its role in psoriasis remains elusive.
    





          Objectives:
        

      
      To reveal the role of PANoptosis in psoriasis for a potential therapeutic strategy.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Multitranscriptomic analysis and experimental validation were used to identify PANoptosis signaling in psoriasis. RNA-seq and scRNA-seq analyses were performed to establish a PANoptosis-mediated immune response in psoriasis, which revealed hub genes through WGCNA and predicted disulfiram as a potential drug. The effect and mechanism of disulfiram were verified in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Here, we found a highlighted PANoptosis signature in psoriasis patients through multitranscriptomic analysis and experimental validation. Based on this, two distinct PANoptosis patterns (non/high) were identified, which were the options for clinical classification. The high-PANoptosis-related group had a higher response rate to immune cell infiltration (such as M1 macrophages and keratinocytes). Subsequently, WGCNA showed the hub genes (e.g., 
S100A12
, 
CYCS
, 
NOD2
, 
STAT1
, 
HSPA4
, 
AIM2
, 
MAPK7
), which were significantly associated with clinical phenotype, PANoptosis signature, and identified immune response in psoriasis. Finally, we explored disulfiram (DSF) as a candidate drug for psoriasis through network pharmacology, which ameliorated IMQ-mediated psoriatic symptoms through antipyroptosis-mediated inflammation and enhanced apoptotic progression. By analyzing the specific ligand-receptor interaction pairs within and between cell lineages, we speculated that DSF might exert its effects by targeting keratinocytes directly or targeting M1 macrophages to downregulate the proliferation of keratinocytes.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      PANoptosis with its mediated immune cell infiltration provides a roadmap for research on the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies of psoriasis."
Induction of HSPA4 and HSPA14 by NBS1 overexpression contributes to NBS1-induced in vitro metastatic and transformation activity,21208456,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21208456,"Background:
        

      
      Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a chromosomal-instability syndrome associated with cancer predisposition, radiosensitivity, microcephaly, and growth retardation. The NBS gene product, NBS1 (p95) or nibrin, is a part of the MRN complex, a central player associated with double-strand break (DSB) repair. We previously demonstrated that NBS1 overexpression contributes to transformation through the activation of PI 3-kinase/Akt. NBS1 overexpression also induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the Snail/MMP2 pathway.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, in vitro migration/invasion, soft agar colony formation, and gelatin zymography assays were performed.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Here we show that heat shock protein family members, A4 and A14, were induced by NBS1 overexpression. siRNA mediated knockdown of HSPA4 or HSPA14 decreased the in vitro migration, invasion, and transformation activity in H1299 cells overexpressing NBS1. However, HSPA4 or HSPA14 induced activity was not mediated through MMP2. NBS1 overexpression induced the expression of heat shock transcription factor 4b (HSF4b), which correlated with the expression of HSPA4 and HSPA14.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      These results identify a novel pathway (NBS1-HSF4b-HSPA4/HSPA14 axis) to induce migration, invasion, and transformation, suggesting the activation of multiple signaling events induced by NBS1 overexpression."
Involvement of heat shock protein a4/apg-2 in refractory inflammatory bowel disease,25437815,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25437815,"Background:
        

      
      Expression of heat shock protein A4 (HSPA4, also called Apg-2), a member of the HSP110 family, is induced by several forms of stress. The physiological and pathological functions of HSPA4 in the intestine remain to be elucidated.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      We assessed HSPA4 expression and function by generating HSPA4-deficient mice and using 214 human intestinal mucosa samples from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
    





          Results:
        

      
      In the colonic mucosa of patients with IBD, a significant correlation was observed between the expression of HSPA4 and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, a T-cell-derived cytokine IL-17 or stem cell markers, such as Sox2. In refractory ulcerative colitis, a condition associated with increased cancer risk, expression of HSPA4 and Bcl-2 was increased in inflammatory cells of colonic mucosae. HSPA4 was overexpressed both in cancer cells and immune cells of human colorectal cancers. Patients with high expression of HSPA4 or Bmi1 showed significantly lower response rates upon subsequent steroid therapy as compared with patients with low expression of each gene. HSPA4-deficient mice exhibit more apoptosis and less expression of IL-17/IL-23 in inflammatory cells and less number of Sox2 cells after administration of dextran sodium sulfate than control mice. Transduction of HspaA4 bone marrow into wild-type mice reduced the immune response.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Upregulation of Bcl-2 and IL-17 by HSPA4 would control apoptosis of inflammatory cells and immune response in the gut, which might develop treatment resistance in IBD. HSPA4 and Bmi1 would be a useful biomarker for refractory clinical course and a promising approach for a therapeutic strategy in patients with IBD."
"Upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPA12A, HSP90B1, HSPA4, HSPA5 and HSPA6) in tumour tissues is associated with poor outcomes from HBV-related early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma",25798051,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25798051,"Background:
        

      
      Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and correlate with aggressiveness and prognosis of HCC.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Using the GSE14520 microarray expression profile from Gene Expression Omnibus, we compared HSP gene expression between tumour and non-tumour tissues and correlated this with outcomes in HCC patients.
    





          Results:
        

      
      We analysed 220 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients and 25 HSPs in this study. With the exception of HSPA4L, HSPA12A and HSPB8, members of the HSP family, including HSPH1, HSPBP1, HSPA1A, HSPA1B, HSPA1L, HSPA2, HSPA4, HSPA5, HSPA8, HSPA9, HSPAA1, HSPAB1, HSPA14, HSPB11, HSPA13, HSP90B1 and HSPBAP1, were all overexpressed in tumour tissues (all P < 0.001). In contrast, HSPB6, HSPB7, HSPA6, HSPB2 and HSPB3 were upregulated in non-tumour tissues (all P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that cirrhosis (HR = 5.282, 95% CI = 1.294-21.555, P = 0.02), Barcelona Clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging (HR = 2.151, 95% CI = 1.682-2.750, P < 0.001), HSPA12A (HR = 1.042, 95% CI = 1.003-1.082, P = 0.033) and HSP90B1 (HR = 1.001, 95% CI = 1.000-1.001, P = 0.011) were negatively associated with survival of HBV-related HCC patients. Furthermore, advanced BCLC staging (HR = 1.797, 95% CI = 1.439-2.244, P < 0.001) was also associated with earlier recurrence of HCC. The high expression of HSPA4 (HR = 1.002, 95% CI = 1.000-1.004, P = 0.019), HSPA5 (HR = 1.0, 95% CI = 1.0-1.0, P = 0.046) and HSPA6 (HR = 1.008, 95% CI = 1.001-1.015, P = 0.021) was similarly associated with HCC recurrence.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      The expression of most HSPs was higher in tumour tissues than in non-tumour tissues. High BCLC staging scores, advanced cirrhosis and the overexpression of HSPA12A and HSP90B1 might be associated with poor survival from HCC, whereas high levels of HSPA4, HSPA5 and HSPA6 might be associated with earlier recurrence of HCC."
Prognostic and immunological roles of heat shock protein A4 in lung adenocarcinoma,38292659,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38292659,"Background:
        

      
      Heat shock protein A4 (HSPA4) belongs to molecular chaperone protein family which plays important roles within variable cellular activities, including cancer initiation and progression. However, the prognostic and immunological significance of HSPA4 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has not been revealed yet.
    





          Aim:
        

      
      To explore the prognostic and immunological roles of HSPA4 to identify a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for LUAD.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      We assessed the prognostic and immunological significance of HSPA4 in LUAD using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The association between HSPA4 expression and clinical-pathological features was assessed through Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Univariate/multivariate Cox regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier curves were employed to evaluate prognostic factors, including HSPA4, in LUAD. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to identify the key signaling pathways associated with HSPA4. The correlation between HSPA4 expression and cancer immune infiltration was evaluated using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA).
    





          Results:
        

      
      Overexpressing HSPA4 was significantly related to advanced pathologic TNM stage, advanced pathologic stage, progression disease status of primary therapy outcome and female subgroups with LUAD. In addition, increased HSPA4 expression was found to be related to worse disease-specific survival and overall survival. GSEA analysis indicated a significant correlation between HSPA4 and cell cycle regulation and immune response, particularly through diminishing the function of cytotoxicity cells and CD8 T cells. The ssGSEA algorithm showed a positive correlation between HSPA4 expression and infiltrating levels of Th2 cells, while a negative correlation was observed with cytotoxic cell infiltration levels.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      Our findings indicate HSPA4 is related to prognosis and immune cell infiltrates and may act as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for LUAD."
Analysis of damage-associated molecular patterns in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis based on ScRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data,37942135,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37942135,"Background:
        

      
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons. Despite extensive research, the exact etiology of ALS remains elusive. Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of the immune system in ALS pathogenesis and progression. Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) are endogenous molecules released by stressed or damaged cells, acting as danger signals and activating immune responses. However, their specific involvement in ALS remains unclear.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      We obtained single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of ALS from the primary motor cortex in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. To better understand genes associated with DAMPs, we performed analyses on cell-cell communication and trajectory. The abundance of immune-infiltrating cells was assessed using the single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) method. We performed univariate Cox analysis to construct the risk model and utilized the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis. Finally, we identified potential small molecule drugs targeting ALS by screening the Connectivity Map database (CMap) and confirmed their potential through molecular docking analysis.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Our study annotated 10 cell types, with the expression of genes related to DAMPs predominantly observed in microglia. Analysis of intercellular communication revealed 12 ligand-receptor pairs in the pathways associated with DAMPs, where microglial cells acted as ligands. Among these pairs, the SPP1-CD44 pair demonstrated the greatest contribution. Furthermore, trajectory analysis demonstrated distinct differentiation fates of different microglial states. Additionally, we constructed a risk model incorporating four genes (TRPM2, ROCK1, HSP90AA1, and HSPA4). The validity of the risk model was supported by multivariate analysis. Moreover, external validation from dataset GSE112681 confirmed the predictive power of the model, which yielded consistent results with datasets GSE112676 and GSE112680. Lastly, the molecular docking analysis suggested that five compounds, namely mead-acid, nifedipine, nifekalant, androstenol, and hydrastine, hold promise as potential candidates for the treatment of ALS.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      Taken together, our study demonstrated that DAMP entities were predominantly observed in microglial cells within the context of ALS. The utilization of a prognostic risk model can accurately predict ALS patient survival. Additionally, genes related to DAMPs may present viable drug targets for ALS therapy."
Heat shock protein A4 controls cell migration and gastric ulcer healing,25655005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25655005,"Aims and methods:
        

      
      Heat shock protein A4 (HSPA4, also called Apg-2), a member of the HSP110 family, regulates the immune response in the gut. Here, we assessed the involvement of HSPA4 in gastric ulcer healing by using fibroblasts from wild-type and HSPA4-deficient mice, a murine gastric ulcer model, and samples from 65 patients with gastric cancer.
    





          Results:
        

      
      HSPA4 expression was inversely correlated with gastric ulcer healing following endoscopic resection of gastric cancer. In the human gastric mucosa, the expression of HSPA4 was inversely correlated with the expression of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), its cognate receptor CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), the stromal cell marker vimentin, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulator Twist. HSPA4 was overexpressed in stromal cells as well as in human gastric cancer cells. HSPA4 deficiency increased the expression of SDF-1 and CXCR4, as well as the number of fibroblast-specific protein 1-positive cells, leading to accelerated ulcer healing in the murine gastric ulcer model. Deletion of HSPA4 promoted cell migration in mouse fibroblasts through increased expression of SDF-1 and Twist.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      HSPA4 regulates the expression of SDF-1 and Twist in fibroblasts, thereby controlling gastric ulcer healing."
Pyroptosis-related gene signature elicits immune response in rosacea,37086043,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37086043,"Rosacea is a complex chronic inflammatory skin disorder with high morbidity. Pyroptosis is known as a regulated inflammatory cell death. While its association with immune response to various inflammatory disorders is well established, little is known about its functional relevance of rosacea. So, we aimed to explore and enrich the pathogenesis involved in pyroptosis-related rosacea aggravations. In this study, we evaluated the pyroptosis-related patterns of rosacea by consensus clustering analysis of 45 ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs), with multiple immune cell infiltration analysis to identify the pyroptosis-mediated immune response in rosacea using GSE65914 dataset. The co-co-work between PRGs and WGCNA-revealed hub genes has established using PPI network. FRG signature was highlighted in rosacea using multi-transcriptomic and experiment analysis. Based on this, three distinct pyroptosis-related rosacea patterns (non/moderate/high) were identified, and the notably enriched pathways have revealed through GO, KEGG and GSEA analysis, especially immune-related pathways. Also, the XCell/MCPcount/ssGSEA/Cibersort underlined the immune-related signalling (NK cells, Monocyte, Neutrophil, Th2 cells, Macrophage), whose hub genes were identified through WGCNA (NOD2, MYD88, STAT1, HSPA4, CXCL8). Finally, we established a pyroptosis-immune co-work during the rosacea aggravations. FRGs may affect the progression of rosacea by regulating the immune cell infiltrations. In all, pyroptosis with its mediated immune cell infiltration is a critical factor during the development of rosacea."
HSP70 binds to specific non-coding RNA and regulates human RNA polymerase III,38266641,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38266641,"Molecular chaperones are critical for protein homeostasis and are implicated in several human pathologies such as neurodegeneration and cancer. While the binding of chaperones to nascent and misfolded proteins has been studied in great detail, the direct interaction between chaperones and RNA has not been systematically investigated. Here, we provide the evidence for widespread interaction between chaperones and RNA in human cells. We show that the major chaperone heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) binds to non-coding RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III (RNA Pol III) such as tRNA and 5S rRNA. Global chromatin profiling revealed that HSP70 binds genomic sites of transcription by RNA Pol III. Detailed biochemical analyses showed that HSP70 alleviates the inhibitory effect of cognate tRNA transcript on tRNA gene transcription. Thus, our study uncovers an unexpected role of HSP70-RNA interaction in the biogenesis of a specific class of non-coding RNA with wider implications in cancer therapeutics."
The expression profiles and prognostic values of HSP70s in hepatocellular carcinoma,34059060,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34059060,"Background:
        

      
      The HSP70 family of heat shock protein plays a critical role in protein synthesis and transport to maintain protein homeostasis. Several studies have indicated that HSP70s are related to the development and occurrence of various cancers.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      The relationship between the overall survival rate of hepatocellular carcinoma patients and the expression of 14 HSP70s from multiple databases, such as TCGA, ONCOMINE, cBioPortal was investigated. Western Blot and PCR were used to evaluate HSPA4 and HSPA14 expressions in various HCC cells to identify suitable cell lines for further experiments .Wound-healing assays, Transwell assays and EdU assays were used to verify the effects of HSPA4 and HSPA14 on the function of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and statistical analysis was performed.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues significantly expressed the 14 HSP70s compared to the normal samples. Besides, the high HSPA1A, HSPA1B, HSPA4, HSPA5, HSPA8, HSPA13, and HSPA14 expressions were inversely associated with the overall survival rate of patients, tumor grade, and cancer stage. A PPI regulatory network was constructed using the 14 HSP70s proteins with HSPA5 and HSPA8 at the network center. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that HSPA4 and HSPA14 could be independent risk factors for the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Cell experiments have also confirmed that reducing HSPA4 and HSPA14 expressions can inhibit the invasion, metastasis, and proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Therefore, the HSP70s significantly influence the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. For instance, HSPA4 and HSPA14 can be novel therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma."
Heat shock protein A4 ablation leads to skeletal muscle myopathy associated with dysregulated autophagy and induced apoptosis,35568953,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35568953,"Background:
        

      
      Molecular chaperones assist protein folding, facilitate degradation of misfolded polypeptides, and thereby maintain protein homeostasis. Impaired chaperone activity leads to defective protein quality control that is implicated in multiple skeletal muscle diseases. The heat shock protein A4 (HSPA4) acts as a co-chaperone for HSP70. Previously, we showed that Hspa4 deletion causes impaired protein homeostasis in the heart. However, its functional role in skeletal muscle has not been explored.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      We performed a comparative phenotypic and biochemical analyses of Hspa4 knockout (KO) mice with wild-type (WT) littermates.
    





          Results:
        

      
      HSPA4 is markedly upregulated in regenerating WT muscle in vivo, and in differentiated myoblasts in vitro. Hspa4-KO mice are marked by growth retardation and increased variability in body weight, accompanied by 35% mortality rates during the peri-weaning period. The surviving Hspa4-KO mice experienced progressive skeletal muscle myopathy, characterized by increased number of muscle fibers with centralized nuclei, heterogeneous myofiber size distribution, inflammatory cell infiltrates and upregulation of embryonic and perinatal myosin heavy chain transcripts. Hspa4-KO muscles demonstrated an accumulation of autophagosome-associated proteins including microtubule associated protein1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and p62/sequestosome accompanied by increased number of TUNEL-positive nuclei.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Our findings underscore the indispensable role of HSPA4 in maintenance of muscle integrity through contribution in skeletal muscle autophagy and apoptosis, which might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for skeletal muscle morbidities."
lncRNA RMRP Prevents Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis via the miR-1-5p/hsp70 Axis in LPS-Induced Sepsis Mice,31900829,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31900829,"Both long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RMRP and heat shock protein (HSP) 70 have been known to play crucial roles in inflammation. The present study investigated the roles of lncRNA RMRP and HSP70 protein 4 (HSPA4) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. The C57BL/6 mice were treated with LPS, following which the cardiomyocytes were isolated for in vitro experiments. Further, a cardiac muscle cell line, HL-1 was transfected with plasmids expressing RMRP and HSPA4, si-NC, si-HSPA4, miR-1-5p mimic, and controls in vitro. Cell apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mRNAs, and proteins were detected in the transfected mice tissues and cells. The LPS treatment significantly reduced the expression levels of RMRP, MMP, and mitochondrial cytochrome C. Moreover, it enhanced the cardiomyocyte apoptosis, intracellular ROS levels, cytoplasm cytochrome C levels, and the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p65 subunit. The predicted RMRP-miR-1-5p-HSPA4 network was validated by co-transfection experiments in vitro in HL-1 cells. The transfection of miR-1-5p-treated cells with pcDNA-RMRP enhanced the levels of the protein HSPA4; however, no change at the mRNA level was observed. Moreover, miR-1-5p mimic attenuated the protective effect of pcDNA-HSPA4 against LPS-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. In addition, we observed that silencing of HSPA4 increased the expression of nuclear p65; however, this effect could be reversed by co-transfection with pcDNA-RMRP. The lncRNA RMRP axis acts as a sponge for miR-1-5p. RMRP inhibits LPS-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and mitochondrial damage by suppressing the post-transcriptional regulatory function of miR-1-5p on HSPA4. We believe that RMRP exhibits therapeutic potential for LPS-induced myocardial dysfunction both in vitro and in vivo."
Distinct gene expression profiles underlie morphological and etiological differences in pediatric cataracts,37203095,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37203095,"Purpose:
        

      
      Pediatric cataract is a major cause of preventable childhood blindness worldwide. Although genetic mutations or infections have been described in patients, the mechanistic basis of human cataract development remains poorly understood. Therefore, gene expression of structural, developmental, profibrotic, and transcription factors in phenotypically and etiologically distinct forms of pediatric cataracts were evaluated.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      This cross-sectional study included 89 pediatric cataract subjects subtyped into 1) prenatal infectious (cytomegalovirus, rubella, and combined cytomegalovirus with rubella infection), 2) prenatal non-infectious, 3) posterior capsular anomalies, 4) postnatal, 5) traumatic, and 6) secondary, and compared to clear, non-cataractous material of eyes with the subluxated lenses. Expression of lens structure-related genes (Aqp-0, HspA4/Hsp70, CrygC), transcription factors (Tdrd7, FoxE3, Maf, Pitx 3) and profibrotic genes (Tgfβ, Bmp7, αSmA, vimentin) in surgically extracted cataract lens material were studied and correlated clinically.
    





          Results:
        

      
      In cataract material, the lens-related gene expression profiles were uniquely associated with phenotype/etiology of different cataracts. Postnatal cataracts showed a significantly altered FoxE3 expression. Low levels of Tdrd7 expression correlated with posterior subcapsular opacity, whereas CrygC correlated significantly with anterior capsular ruptures. The expression of Aqp0 and Maf was elevated in infectious cataracts, particularly in CMV infections, compared to other cataract subtypes. Tgfβ showed significantly low expression in various cataract subtypes, whereas vimentin had elevated gene expression in infectious and prenatal cataracts.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      A significant association between lens gene expression patterns in phenotypically and etiologically distinct subtypes of pediatric cataracts suggests regulatory mechanisms in cataractogenesis. The data reveal that cataract formation and presentation is a consequence of altered expression of a complex network of genes."
Basigin is necessary for normal decidualization of human uterine stromal cells,36303457,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36303457,"Study question:
        

      
      Does basigin (BSG) regulate human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization in vitro?
    





          Summary answer:
        

      
      BSG regulates HESCs proliferation and decidualization.
    





          What is known already:
        

      
      Studies have shown that in the human endometrium, BSG expression is menstrual-cycle dependent and its expression was significantly lower in uterine endometrium during the luteal phase of women experiencing multiple implantation failures after IVF than in women with normal fertility.
    





          Study design, size, duration:
        

      
      We utilized a telomerase-immortalized HESCs in an in vitro cell culture model system to investigate whether BSG regulates decidualization of stromal cells. Further, we used microarray analysis to identify changes in the gene expression profile of HESCs treated with BSG small interfering RNA (siRNA). All experiments were repeated at least three times.
    





          Participants/materials, setting, methods:
        

      
      The effect of BSG knockdown (using siRNA) on HESC proliferation was determined by counting cell number and by tritiated thymidine incorporation assays. The effect of BSG on decidualization of HESCs was determined by RT-qPCR for the decidualization markers insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) and prolactin (PRL). Immunoblotting was used to determine the effect of BSG siRNA on the expression of MMP-2,3. Microarray analysis was used to identify BSG-regulated genes in HESCs at Day 6 of decidualization. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were then carried out on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The STRING online database was used to analyze protein-protein interaction (PPI) between DEG-encoded proteins, and CytoScape software was used to visualize the interaction. MCODE and CytoHubba were used to construct functional modules and screen hub genes separately. Several BSG-regulated genes identified in the microarray analysis were confirmed by qPCR.
    





          Main results and the role of chance:
        

      
      Knockdown of BSG expression in cultured stromal cells by siRNA significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited HESC proliferation, disrupted cell decidualization and down-regulated MMP-2 and MMP-3 expression. Microarray analysis identified 721 genes that were down-regulated, and 484 genes up-regulated with P < 0.05 in BSG siRNA treated HESCs. GO term enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in cell communication, signaling transduction and regulation, response to stimulus, cell adhesion, anatomical structure morphogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, as well as other functional pathways. KEGG pathway analysis identified upregulated gene enriched in pathways such as the MAPK signaling pathway, colorectal cancer, melanoma and axon guidance. In contrast, downregulated genes were mainly enriched in pathways including ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, pathways in cancer, antigen processing, type I diabetes mellitus and focal adhesion. The top 10 hub nodes were identified using 12 methods analyses. The hub genes that showed up in two methods were screened out. Among these genes, upregulated genes included EGFR, HSP90AA1, CCND1, PXN, PRKACB, MGAT4A, EVA1A, LGALS1, STC2, HSPA4; downregulated genes included WNT4/5, FOXO1, CDK1, PIK3R1, IGF1, JAK2, LAMB1, ITGAV, HGF, MXRA8, TMEM132A, UBE2C, QSOX1, ERBB2, GNB4, HSP90B1, LAMB2, LAMC1 and ITGA1. Hub genes and module genes involved in the top three modules of PPI analysis were analyzed through the string database. Analysis showed that hub and module genes were related mainly to the WNT signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and pathways in cancer.
    





          Large scale data:
        

      
      The microarray data set generated in this study has been published online at databank.illinois.edu.
    





          Limitations, reasons for caution:
        

      
      Most of the findings were obtained using an in vitro cell culture system that may not necessarily reflect in vivo functions.
    





          Wider implications of the findings:
        

      
      Our results demonstrate that BSG plays a vital role in decidualization and that downregulation of BSG in the uterine endometrium may be associated with infertility in women. The identified hub genes and pathways increase our understanding of the genetic etiology and molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of decidualization by BSG.

Chemoproteomic Approach for the Quantitative Identification of Arsenic-Binding Proteins,36269594,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36269594,"Arsenic is a widespread environmental contaminant, and long-term exposure to arsenic in drinking water is known to be associated with the development of many human diseases. Identification of arsenic-binding proteins is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of arsenic species. Here, we developed a chemoproteomic strategy, relying on the use of a biotin-As(III) probe, stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, to identify quantitatively As(III)-binding proteins. Over 400 proteins were enriched from the lysate of HEK293T cells with streptavidin beads immobilized with the biotin-As(III) probe. Competitive labeling experiments in the presence or absence of 
p
-aminophenylarsenoxide (PAPAO) revealed 51 candidate As(III)-binding proteins, including several molecular chaperones and cochaperones, that is, HSPA4, HSPA4L, HSPH1, HOP1, FKBP51, and FKBP52. We also validated, by employing western blot analysis, the ability of HSPA4, a member of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family, in binding with PAPAO and sodium arsenite in vitro. Together, our work led to the identification of a number of new As(III)-interaction proteins, and our results suggest that As(III) may perturb proteostasis partly through binding directly with molecular chaperones."
"Evidence for a common biological pathway linking three Parkinson's disease-causing genes: parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1",25761903,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25761903,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Autosomal recessive, early-onset cases of PD are predominantly caused by mutations in the parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1 genes. Animal and cellular models have verified a direct link between parkin and PINK1, whereby PINK1 phosphorylates and activates parkin at the outer mitochondrial membrane, resulting in removal of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy. Despite the overwhelming evidence for this interaction, few studies have been able to identify a link for DJ-1 with parkin or PINK1. The aim of this review is to summarise the functions of these three proteins, and to analyse the existing evidence for direct and indirect interactions between them. DJ-1 is able to rescue the phenotype of PINK1-knockout Drosophila models, but not of parkin-knockouts, suggesting that DJ-1 may act in a parallel pathway to that of the PINK1/parkin pathway. To further elucidate a commonality between these three proteins, bioinformatics analysis established that Miro (RHOT1) interacts with parkin and PINK1, and HSPA4 interacts with all three proteins. Furthermore, 30 transcription factors were found to be common amongst all three proteins, with many of them being involved in transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, expression of these proteins and their associated transcription factors are found to be significantly down-regulated in PD patients compared to healthy controls. In summary, this review provides insight into common pathways linking three PD-causing genes and highlights some key questions, the answers to which may provide critical insight into the disease process."

      We calculated PR for each placenta expressing gene and defined the top 99 genes with high PR as important genes. GAPDH has the highest PR. The 99 genes had different expression pattern in placental cell types. FN1 is up-regulated in 8 w EVT compared to 8 w CTB and 24 w EVT compared to 8 w EVT. HSPA4 is down-regulated in 8 w EVT compared to 8 w CTB and 24 w EVT compared to 8 w EVT. MIB2, TLR4, and UBB are consistently changed in preeclampsia (PE). UBB and ACTG1 were identified to be down-regulated in fetal growth restriction (FGR). SOD1 is down-regulated in preterm birth placenta.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      Our findings confirmed that the importance of these genes in placenta-related diseases, and provide new candidates (MIB2, UBB, ACTG1, and SOD1) for placenta-related disease diagnosis and treatment."
Identification and Analysis of Immune-Related Gene Signature in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,36292719,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36292719,"Background:
        

      
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) originates from the hepatocytes and accounts for 90% of liver cancer. The study intends to identify novel prognostic biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients based on TCGA and GSE14520 cohorts.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Differential analysis was employed to obtain the DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) of the TCGA-LIHC-TPM cohort. The lasso regression analysis was applied to build the prognosis model through using the TCGA cohort as the training group and the GSE14520 cohort as the testing group. Next, based on the prognosis model, we performed the following analyses: the survival analysis, the independent prognosis analysis, the clinical feature analysis, the mutation analysis, the immune cell infiltration analysis, the tumor microenvironment analysis, and the drug sensitivity analysis. Finally, the survival time of HCC patients was predicted by constructing nomograms.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Through the lasso regression analysis, we obtained a prognosis model of ten genes including 
BIRC5
 (baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5), 
CDK4
 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4), 
DCK
 (deoxycytidine kinase), 
HSPA4
 (heat shock protein family A member 4), 
HSP90AA1
 (heat shock protein 90 α family class A member 1), 
PSMD2
 (Proteasome 26S Subunit Ubiquitin Receptor, Non-ATPase 2), 
IL1RN
 (interleukin 1 receptor antagonist), 
PGF
 (placental growth factor), 
SPP1
 (secreted phosphoprotein 1), and 
STC2
 (stanniocalcin 2). First, we found that the risk score is an independent prognosis factor and is related to the clinical features of HCC patients, covering AFP (α-fetoprotein) and stage. Second, we observed that the 
p53
 mutation was the most obvious mutation between the high-risk and low-risk groups. Third, we also discovered that the risk score is related to some immune cells, covering B cells, T cells, dendritic, macrophages, neutrophils, etc. Fourth, the high-risk group possesses a lower TIDE score, a higher expression of immune checkpoints, and higher ESTIMATE score. Finally, nomograms include the clinical features and risk signatures, displaying the clinical utility of the signature in the survival prediction of HCC patients.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Through the comprehensive analysis, we constructed an immune-related prognosis model to predict the survival of HCC patients. In addition to predicting the survival time of HCC patients, this model significantly correlates with the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, we concluded that these ten immune-related genes (
BIRC5
, 
CDK4
, 
DCK
, 
HSPA4
, 
HSP90AA1
, 
PSMD2
, 
IL1RN
, 
PGF
, 
SPP1
, and 
STC2
) serve as novel targets for antitumor immunity. Therefore, this study plays a significant role in exploring the clinical application of immune-related genes."
PhosSNPs-Regulated Gene Network and Pathway Significant for Rheumatoid Arthritis,34569543,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34569543,"Objectives:
        

      
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are critical for immunity and participate in multiple human diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). PhosSNPs are nonsynonymous SNPs influencing protein phosphorylation, thus probably modulate cell signaling and gene expression. We aimed to identify phosSNPs-regulated gene network/pathway potentially significant for RA.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      We collected genome-wide phosSNP genotyping data and transcriptome-wide mRNA expression data from PBMCs of a Chinese sample. We discovered and verified with public datasets differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with RA, and replicated RA-associated SNPs in our study sample. We performed a targeted expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study on significant phosSNPs and DEGs.
    





          Results:
        

      
      We identified 29 nominally significant eQTL phosSNPs and 83 target genes, and constructed comprehensive regulatory/interaction networks, highlighting the vital effects of two eQTL phosSNPs (rs371513 and rs4824675, FDR <0.05) and four critical node genes (HSPA4, NDUFA2, MRPL15, and ATP5O). Besides, two node/key genes NDUFA2 and ATP5O, regulated by rs371513, were significantly enriched in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Besides, four pairs of eQTL effects were replicated independently in whole blood and/or transformed fibroblasts.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      The findings delineated a potential role of protein phosphorylation and genetic variations in RA and warranted the significant roles of phosSNPs in regulating RA-associated genes expression in PBMCs. The results pointed out the relevance and significance of oxidative phosphorylation pathway to RA."
Prognostic model of immune-related genes for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,35937592,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35937592,"Background:
        

      
      Immune-related genes (IRGs) are closely connected to the occurrence and development of tumors. Their influence on the prognosis of patients with HCC, however, remains unclear.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      From the TCGA database, we integrated 365 liver cancer tissues and 50 normal tissues to identify differential immune genes related to prognosis. Multivariate COX analysis was used to establish a new prognostic index on account of IRGs, whereby risk score = (Expression level of HSPA4*0.022) + (Expression level of PSMD14*0.042) + (Expression level of RBP2*0.019) + (Expression level of MAPT*0.197) + (Expression level of TRAF3*0.146) + (Expression level of NDRG1*(0.006) + (Expression level of NRAS*0.027) + (Expression level of IL17D*0.075).
    





          Results:
        

      
      The risk score was clearly correlated with an unfavorable survival rate and with clinical characteristics. By integrating the immune-related risk score model with clinical features, a nomogram was constructed to predict the survival rate of HCC patients (1-, 3- and 5-year AUC of 0.721, 0.747 and 0.781, respectively).
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      We have established a valuable prognostic risk score for HCC patients that may be a better predictor of survival than the present method. With the risk score's strong predictive value for immune cells and functions, it may provide clinical guidance for the diagnosis and prognosis of different immunophenotypes, and provide multiple therapeutic targets for the treatment of HCC patients based on subtype-specific immune molecules."
Fine-tuning of the Hsc70-based Human Protein Disaggregase Machinery by the Distinctive C-terminal Extension of Apg2,36167183,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36167183,"Apg2, one of the three cytosolic Hsp110 chaperones in humans, supports reactivation of unordered and ordered protein aggregates by Hsc70 (HspA8). Together with DnaJB1, Apg2 serves to nucleate Hsc70 molecules into sites where productive entropic pulling forces can be developed. During aggregate reactivation, Apg2 performs as a specialized nucleotide exchange factor, but the origin of its specialization is poorly defined. Here we report on the role of the distinctive C-terminal extension present in Apg2 and other metazoan homologs. We found that the first part of this Apg2 subdomain, with propensity to adopt α-helical structure, interacts with the nucleotide binding domain of Hsc70 in a nucleotide-dependent manner, contributing significantly to the stability of the Hsc70:Apg2 complex. Moreover, the second intrinsically disordered segment of Apg2 C-terminal extension plays an important role as a downregulator of nucleotide exchange. An NMR analysis showed that the interaction with Hsc70 nucleotide binding domain modifies the chemical environment of residues located in important functional sites such as the interface between lobe I and II and the nucleotide binding site. Our data indicate that Apg2 C-terminal extension is a fine-tuner of human Hsc70 activity that optimizes the substrate remodeling ability of the chaperone system."
Increased eHSP70-to-iHSP70 ratio in prediabetic and diabetic postmenopausal women: a biomarker of cardiometabolic risk,35767179,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35767179,"Decreased estrogen levels in menopause are associated with anthropometric, metabolic, and inflammatory impairments, predisposing women to cardiometabolic risk factors such as diabetes. Menopause and type two diabetes (DM2) are marked by altered heat shock response (HSR), shown by decreased expression of the 70-kDa heat shock protein in the intracellular milieu (iHSP70). While iHSP70 plays an anti-inflammatory role, extracellular HSP70 (eHSP70) may mediate pro-inflammatory pathways and has been associated with insulin resistance in DM2. Considering the roles of these proteins according to localization, the eHSP70-to-iHSP70 ratio (H-index) has been proposed as a biomarker for HSR. We, therefore, evaluated whether this biomarker is associated with glycemic and inflammatory status in postmenopausal women. In this transversal study, 36 postmenopausal women were grouped according to fasting glycemia status as either the control group (normoglycemic, ≤ 99 mg/dL) or DM2 (prediabetic and diabetic, glycemia ≥ 100 mg/dL). DM2 group showed higher triglyceride/glucose (TyG) index and plasma atherogenic index (PAI), both of which are indicators of cardiometabolic risk. In addition, we found that the eHSP70-to-iHSP70 ratio (plasma/peripheral blood mononuclear cells-PBMC ratio) was higher in the DM2 group, compared with the control group. Furthermore, blood leukocyte and glycemia levels were positively correlated with the eHSP70-to-iHSP70 ratio in women that presented H-index values above 1.0 (a.u.). Taken together, our results highlight the eHSP70-to-iHSP70 ratio as a biomarker of altered HSR in DM2 postmenopausal women."
Identification of abnormal protein expressions associated with mouse spermatogenesis induced by cyclophosphamide,33438283,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33438283,"Cyclophosphamide (CP) is a clinical anticancer drug that can cause male reproductive abnormalities, but the underlying mechanisms for this remain unknown. The present study aimed to explore the potential toxicity induced by CP in spermatogenesis events of germ cell proliferation, meiosis, and blood-testis barrier integrity at the molecular level. CP-treated mice showed significantly reduced serum testosterone levels, sperm motility and concentration. The results of immunohistochemistry and Western blot showed that CP reduced the proliferation of germ cells (PCNA, PLZF) and increased germ cell apoptosis (Bax and TUNEL-positive cells) in CP-treated mice testes. The expression of meiotic related proteins (SYCP3, REC8, MLH1) decreased significantly in the fourth week after administration, and the expression of blood-testis barrier related proteins (β-catenin, ZO-1) and sperm quality-associated proteins (PGK2, HSPA4) decreased significantly in the first week after administration. CP leads to the apoptosis of male germ cells, inhibits the proliferation of germ cells, and affects meiosis and the blood-testis barrier, resulting in the decline of sperm quality. This study provides information to further the study of molecular mechanism and protective strategy of CP influence."
Genetic Diversity and Selective Signature in Dabieshan Cattle Revealed by Whole-Genome Resequencing,36138806,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36138806,"Dabieshan cattle are a typical breed of southern Chinese cattle that have the characteristics of muscularity, excellent meat quality and tolerance to temperature and humidity. Based on 148 whole-genome data, our analysis disclosed the ancestry components of Dabieshan cattle with Chinese indicine (0.857) and East Asian taurine (0.139). The Dabieshan genome demonstrated a higher genomic diversity compared with the other eight populations, supported by the observed nucleotide diversity, linkage disequilibrium decay and runs of homozygosity. The candidate genes were detected by a selective sweep, which might relate to the fertility (

In Silico Analysis of HSP70 Gene Family in Bovine Genome,32840700,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32840700,"Heat shock proteins (HSPs), members of molecular chaperones families fulfill essential roles under normal conditions and provide protection and adaptation during and after stress. Among different HSPs, HSP70 kDa family of proteins is most abundant and well-studied in human and mouse but has not yet been characterized in bovines. In silico analysis was performed to characterize members of HSP70 gene family in bovine genome and a total of 17 genes of bovine HSP70 gene family were identified. The members of HSP70 family were distributed over 12 chromosomes with gene size ranging from 1911 (HSPA2) to 54,017 bp (HSPA4). Five genes were intronless, while rest of 12 genes were multiexonic. Phylogenetic analysis of HSP70 gene family distinguished them into eight major evolutionary groups wherein members of group 1 were most divergent and quite dissimilar than from rest of the HSP70 sequences. Domain structure of all bovine HSP70 genes was conserved and three signature patterns HSP70_1, HSP70_2, and HSP70_3 were identified. HSPA8, HSP9, and HSPA1A showed comparatively higher expression in majority of tissues. Like humans, bovine HSP70 family was characterized by remarkable evolutionary diversity. The analysis also suggested resemblance of bovine HSP70 family to that of human compared to mouse. Overall, the study indicates the presence of diversity for structure, function, localization, and expression in the bovine HSP70 family chaperons which could form the basis to understand thermotolerance/adaptive changes in the bovines."
Stress Response Protein RBM3 Promotes the Development of Colitis-associated Cancer,27930406,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27930406,"Background:
        

      
      Colitis-associated cancer (CAC) is caused by chronic intestinal inflammation and often results from refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Stress response proteins Cirp and HSPA4 are involved in the refractory clinical course and development of CAC. RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) is induced in response to various stresses and is upregulated in several cancers. However, the role of RBM3 in CAC is unclear.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      We assessed RBM3 expression and function in 263 human intestinal mucosa samples from patients with IBD and in Rbm3-deficient (Rbm3) mice.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Expression of RBM3 was correlated with the expression of stress response proteins Cirp, HSPA4, and HSP27 in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBD. Significant correlation was observed between the expression of RBM3 and that of Bcl-xL or stem cell markers. RBM3 expression increased and significantly correlated with R-spondin expression in the colonic mucosa of patients with refractory IBD, a condition associated with increased cancer risk, and RBM3 was overexpressed in human CACs. In the murine CAC model, Rbm3 deficiency decreased R-spondin and Bcl-xL expression and increased apoptotic cell number in the colonic mucosa, leading to reduced tumor multiplicity. Transplantation of wild-type and Rbm3 bone marrow did not alter tumor burden, indicating the importance of RBM3 in epithelial cells.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Our findings indicated that RBM3 was required for efficient inflammatory carcinogenesis in the murine CAC model and suggested that RBM3 could be a predictive biomarker of CAC risk and a new therapeutic target for cancer prevention in patients with IBD."
Immunogenomic Landscape Analysis of Prognostic Immune-Related Genes in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,34745496,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34745496,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. HBV infection is an important risk factor for the tumorigenesis of HCC, given that the inflammatory environment is closely related to morbidity and prognosis. Consequently, it is of urgent importance to explore the immunogenomic landscape to supplement the prognosis of HCC. The expression profiles of immune-related genes (IRGs) were integrated with 377 HCC patients to generate differentially expressed IRGs based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. These IRGs were evaluated and assessed in terms of their diagnostic and prognostic values. A total of 32 differentially expressed immune-related genes resulted as significantly correlated with the overall survival of HCC patients. The Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were actively involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. A prognostic signature based on IRGs (HSPA4, PSME3, PSMD14, FABP6, ISG20L2, TRAF3, NDRG1, NRAS, CSPG5, and IL17D) stratified patients into high-risk versus low-risk groups in terms of overall survival and remained as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analyses after adjusting for clinical and pathologic factors. Several IRGs (HSPA4, PSME3, PSMD14, FABP6, ISG20L2, TRAF3, NDRG1, NRAS, CSPG5, and IL17D) of clinical significance were screened in the present study, revealing that the proposed clinical-immune signature is a promising risk score for predicting the prognosis of HCC."

Comparative proteomics analysis of gastric cancer stem cells,25379943,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25379943,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for cancer progression, metastasis, and recurrence. To date, the specific markers of CSCs remain undiscovered. The aim of this study was to identify novel biomarkers of gastric CSCs for clinical diagnosis using proteomics technology. CSC-like SP cells, OCUM-12/SP cells, OCUM-2MD3/SP cells, and their parent OCUM-12 cells and OCUM-2MD3 cells were used in this study. Protein lysates from each cell line were analyzed using QSTAR Elite Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry, coupled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation technology. Candidate proteins detected by proteomics technology were validated by immunohistochemical analysis of 300 gastric cancers. Based on the results of LC-MS/MS, eight proteins, including RBBP6, GLG1, VPS13A, DCTPP1, HSPA9, HSPA4, ALDOA, and KRT18, were up-regulated in both OCUM-12/SP cells and OCUM-2MD3/SP cells when compared to their corresponding parent cells. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression level of RBBP6, HSPA4, DCTPP1, HSPA9, VPS13A, ALDOA, GLG1, and CK18 was high in OCUM-12/SP and OCUM-2MD3/SP, in compared with the control of parent OCUM-12 and OCUM-2MD3. These proteins were significantly associated with advanced invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, or advanced clinical stage. RBBP6, DCTPP1, HSPA4, and ALDOA expression in particular were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in the 300 gastric cancer patients. RBBP6 was determined to be an independent prognostic factor. The motility-stimulating ability of OCUM-12/SP cells and OCUM-2MD3/SP cells was inhibited by RBBP6 siRNA. These findings might suggest that the eight proteins, RBBP6, GLG1, VPS13A, DCTPP1, HSPA9, HSPA4, ALDOA, and KRT18, utilizing comparative proteomics analysis, were perceived to be potential CSC markers of gastric cancer. Of the eight candidate proteins, RBBP6 was suggested to be a promising prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for gastric cancer."
Identification and characterization of hADSC-derived exosome proteins from different isolation methods,34235869,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34235869,"Exosomes are secreted into the extracellular space by most cell types and contain various molecular constituents, which play roles in many biological processes. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) can differentiate into a variety of cell types and secrete a series of paracrine factors through exosomes. ADSC-derived exosomes have shown diagnostic and therapeutic potential in many clinical diseases. The molecular components are critical for their mechanisms. Several methods have been developed for exosome purification, including ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, density gradient purification, size-based isolation, polymer precipitation and immuno-affinity purification. Thus, we employed four methods to isolate exosomes from the hADSC culture medium, including ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, ExoQuick-TC precipitation and ExoQuick-TC ULTRA isolation. Following exosome isolation, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis of the exosome proteins using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labelling, combined with 2D-LC-MS/MS. There were 599 universal and 138 stably expressed proteins in hADSC-derived exosomes. We proved that these proteins were potential hADSC-derived exosomes markers, including CD109, CD166, HSPA4, TRAP1, RAB2A, RAB11B and RAB14. From the quantitative proteomic analysis, we demonstrated that hADSC-derived exosome protein expression varied, with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, in the different isolation methods. Pathway analysis and proliferation, migration and endothelial tube formation assays showed varying effects in cells stimulated with hADSC-derived exosomes from different isolation methods. Our study revealed that different isolation methods might introduce variations in the protein composition in exosomes, which reflects their effects on biological function. The pros and cons of these methods are important points to consider for downstream research applications."
Development of an immune-related prognostic index associated with hepatocellular carcinoma,32191631,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32191631,"Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), an inflammation-associated cancer induced by a variety of etiological factors, is still one of the most prevalent and lethal cancers in human population. In this study, the expression profiles of immune-related genes (IRGs) were integrated with the overall survival (OS) of 378 LIHC patients based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Moreover, the differentially expressed and survival related IRGs among LIHC patients were predicted through the computational difference algorithm and COX regression analysis. As a result, 7 genes, including HSPA4, S100A10, FABP6, CACYBP, HDAC1, FCGR2B and SHC1, were retrieved to construct a predictive model associated with the overall survival (OS) of LIHC patients. Typically, the as-constructed model performed moderately in predicting prognosis, which was also correlated with tumor grade. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the genes of high-risk group were actively involved in mRNA binding and the spliceosome pathway. Intriguingly, the prognostic index established based on IRGs reflected infiltration by multiple types of immunocytes. Our findings screen several IRGs with clinical significance, reveal the drivers of immune repertoire, and illustrate the importance of a personalized, IRG-based immune signature in LIHC recognition, surveillance, and prognosis prediction."

The multi-target mechanism of Cyclosporin A in the treatment of vitiligo based on network pharmacology,34089287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34089287,"Network pharmacology is an emerging discipline that designs drugs based on systems biology theory and biological system network analysis. Here, we applied network pharmacology to analyze the multi-target mechanism of Cyclosporin A in the treatment of vitiligo First, we predicted the targets of Cyclosporin A. Second, we obtained the genes related to vitiligo from the database. Third, we constructed the PPI network of the mutual genes between Cyclosporin A and vitiligo and used gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) to analyze. Finally, we verified the prediction of potential targets through a docking study with Cyclosporin A. We found that there were 15 shared target genes between Cyclosporin A and vitiligo. We analyzed these 15 genes by Cytoscape and obtained a network diagram of 885 nodes. Through screening and molecular docking, PRKDC, CUL7, CUL1, HSPA8, HSPA4, and SIRT7 were the most likely multi-target mechanism of Cyclosporin A in the treatment of vitiligo. In our study, Cyclosporin A might not only affect the repair of DNA strands by targeting PRKDC, but also affected the innate and adaptive immune function of vitiligo patients by the targets of CUL1, CUL7, and HSP70. In addition, Cyclosporin A might promote the repigmentation of vitiligo by adjusting the expression of SIRT7."
Relationship between the Plasma Proteome and Changes in Inflammatory Markers after Bariatric Surgery,34685777,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34685777,"Severe obesity is a disease associated with multiple adverse effects on health. Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) can have significant effects on multiple body systems and was shown to improve inflammatory markers in previous short-term follow-up studies. We evaluated associations between changes in inflammatory markers (CRP, IL6 and TNFα) and circulating proteins after MBS.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) proteomics was performed on plasma samples taken at baseline (pre-surgery) and 6 and 12 months after MBS, and concurrent analyses of inflammatory/metabolic parameters were carried out. The change in absolute abundances of those proteins, showing significant change at both 6 and 12 months, was tested for correlation with the absolute and percentage (%) change in inflammatory markers.
    





          Results:
        

      
      We found the following results: at 6 months, there was a correlation between %change in IL-6 and fold change in 
HSPA4
 (rho = -0.659; 
p
 = 0.038) and in 
SERPINF1
 (rho = 0.714, 
p
 = 0.020); at 12 months, there was a positive correlation between %change in IL-6 and fold change in the following proteins-
LGALS3BP
 (rho = 0.700, 
p
 = 0.036), 
HSP90B1
 (rho = 0.667; 
p
 = 0.05) and 
ACE
 (rho = 0.667, 
p
 = 0.05). We found significant inverse correlations at 12 months between %change in TNFα and the following proteins: 
EPHX2
 and 
ACE
 (for both rho = -0.783, 
p
 = 0.013). We also found significant inverse correlations between %change in CRP at 12 months and 
SHBG
 (rho = -0.759, 
p
 = 0.029), 
L1CAM
 (rho = -0.904, 
p
 = 0.002) and 
AMBP
 (rho = -0.684, 
p
 = 0.042).
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      Using SWATH-MS, we identified several proteins that are involved in the inflammatory response whose levels change in patients who achieve remission of T2DM after bariatric surgery in tandem with changes in IL6, TNFα and/or CRP. Future studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms in how MBS decreases low-grade inflammation."
A novel prognostic index of hepatocellular carcinoma based on immunogenomic landscape analysis,32853412,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32853412,"Changes in immune responses to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are closely related to the occurrence, development, and prognosis of this disease. Exploring the role of immune-related genes (IRGs) in HCC would provide insights into the mechanisms regulating this disease. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) provide a platform for such research, owing to a large number of HCC samples available for comprehensive and systematic immunogenomics analyses. We analyzed the IRGs expression profile and clinical information of patients with HCC based on the TCGA and ICGC database. Potential molecular mechanisms and properties of the screened IRGs were analyzed across multiple databases. And we analyzed the correlation between IRGs, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and copy number variation. A novel prognostic index, based on IRGs, was developed using the LASSO Cox regression algorithm, followed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to analyze the prognostic index. Information in the ICGC database was used to verify the reliability of the prognostic index. A total of 54 differentially expressed IRGs were found to be significantly associated with HCC prognosis, and there is a significant correlation between their expression level and copy number variation. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that the genes play active roles in tumor and immune-related signaling pathways. In addition, five potential biomarkers namely IRG, MAPK3, HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, HSPA4, and CDK4, were identified. Finally, a novel prognostic index, based on IRGs (PSMD14, FABP6, ISG20L2, HGF, BIRC5, IL17D, and STC2), was found useful as an independent prognostic factor, not only for prognosis but also to reflect levels of infiltration in a variety of immune cells. Our team conducted a genomics study of IRGs in HCC and screened several clinically significant IRGs, and our model provides an effective approach for stratification and characterization of patients using IRG-based immunolabeling tools to monitor the prognosis of HCC."
Whole-Genome Analyses Reveal Genomic Characteristics and Selection Signatures of Lincang Humped Cattle at the China-Myanmar Border,35391795,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35391795,"The location on the Yunnan border with Myanmar and its unique cultural landscape has shaped Lincang humped cattle over time. In the current study, we investigated the genetic characteristics of 22 Lincang humped cattle using whole-genome resequencing data. We found that Lincang humped cattle derived from both Indian indicine and Chinese indicine cattle depicted higher levels of genomic diversity. Based on genome-wide scans, candidate genomic regions were identified that were potentially involved in local thermal and humid environmental adaptions, including genes associated with the body size (

Low Birth Weight Intensifies Changes in Markers of Hepatocarcinogenesis Induced by Fructose Consumption in Rats,36295788,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36295788,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to fetal exposure to glucocorticoid excess results in metabolic inflexibility and hepatic steatosis upon nutritional stress during adulthood. We previously demonstrated that rats born to dexamethasone (DEX)-treated mothers developed hepatic steatosis when exposed to 10% fructose solution during adult life. Persistent triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation in the liver, in turn, is a feature of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which serves as a risk factor for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we demonstrate that the combination of IUGR and fructose treatment during adulthood also results in increased hepatic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, AKT phosphorylation and serum aspartate transaminase. Growth-restricted rats also presented reduced hepatic TRIB3 and GADD45a after fructose treatment. Other markers of cell proliferation, such as Cyclin D, PCNA, Hgf and Hspa4/Hsp70 expression and the number of Ki-67 positive cells, were all increased in the liver of growth- restricted rats treated with fructose. On the other hand, the combination of IUGR and fructose treatment during adult life reduced the levels of IGF-1. In conclusion, our data indicate that after exposure to fructose, adult rats subjected to dexamethasone-induced IUGR display exacerbated molecular changes in markers of NASH and HCC."
Systematic Analysis of Sex-Linked Molecular Alterations and Therapies in Cancer,26755347,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26755347,"Though patient sex influences response to cancer treatments, little is known of the molecular causes, and cancer therapies are generally given irrespective of patient sex. We assessed transcriptomic differences in tumors from men and women spanning 17 cancer types, and we assessed differential expression between tumor and normal samples stratified by sex across 7 cancers. We used the LincsCloud platform to perform Connectivity Map analyses to link transcriptomic signatures identified in male and female tumors with chemical and genetic perturbagens, and we performed permutation testing to identify perturbagens that showed significantly differential connectivity with male and female tumors. Our analyses predicted that females are sensitive and males are resistant to tamoxifen treatment of lung adenocarcinoma, a finding which is consistent with known male-female differences in lung cancer. We made several novel predictions, including that CDK1 and PTPN1 knockdown would be more effective in males with hepatocellular carcinoma, and SMAD3 and HSPA4 knockdown would be more effective in females with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Our results provide a new resource for researchers studying male-female biological and treatment response differences in human cancer. The complete results of our analyses are provided at the website accompanying this manuscript (http://becklab.github.io/SexLinked)."
Integrated analysis of differentially expressed genes implicated in ovarian cancer progression,38073191,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38073191,"Objective:
        

      
      Ovarian cancer (OC) is a common gynecological malignancy associated with high morbidity and generally poor prognosis despite treatment. The aim of this study was to understand the influence of gene expression differences and pathways in OC development and progression.
    





          Materials and methods:
        

      
      One hundred and thirty-three OC samples and 34 normal ovarian tissues were included in the study from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. GeneSpring Software was used to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in all stages comparing tumor and normaltissue. DEGs were analyzed using the DAVID interface for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. Most most connected genes were selected as hub genes for each stage using the STRING application in Cytoscape software.
    





          Results:
        

      
      DEGs were found to be associated with cell cycle and herpes simplex virus infection pathways. A total of 19 genes (
ACTB, AKT1, ALB, CTNNB1, EGFR, EP300, ESR1, FN1, GAPDH, HSPA4, IL6, JUN, MYC, PTEN, RPS27A, SRC, TNF, TP53

TP53
 gene was found to have the highest level of connections in all stages. EGFR, RPS27A, and AKT1 were found to have high numbers of connections in stages II, III, and IV, respectively.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      The results of the current study may provide new insights into OC pathogenesis and suggest potential prognostic and therapeutic targets."
Molecular studies of phenotype variation in canine RPGR-XLPRA1,27122963,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27122963,"Purpose:
        

      
      Canine X-linked progressive retinal atrophy 1 (XLPRA1) caused by a mutation in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) GTPase regulator (RPGR) exon ORF15 showed significant variability in disease onset in a colony of dogs that all inherited the same mutant X chromosome. Defective protein trafficking has been detected in XLPRA1 before any discernible degeneration of the photoreceptors. We hypothesized that the severity of the photoreceptor degeneration in affected dogs may be associated with defects in genes involved in ciliary trafficking. To this end, we examined six genes as potential disease modifiers. We also examined the expression levels of 24 genes involved in ciliary trafficking (seven), visual pathway (five), neuronal maintenance genes (six), and cellular stress response (six) to evaluate their possible involvement in early stages of the disease.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Samples from a pedigree derived from a single XLPRA1-affected male dog outcrossed to unrelated healthy mix-bred or purebred females were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot, mutational and haplotype analysis, and gene expression (GE). Cell-specific markers were used to examine retinal remodeling in the disease. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the entire RPGR interacting and protein trafficking genes (RAB8A, RPGRIP1L, CEP290, CC2D2A, DFNB31, and RAB11B) were genotyped in the pedigree. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to examine the expression of a total of 24 genes, including the six genes listed.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Examination of cryosections from XLPRA1-affected animals of similar age (3-4 years) with different disease severity phenotype revealed mislocalization of opsins and upregulation of the Müller cell gliosis marker GFAP. Four to ten haplotypes per gene were identified in RAB8A, RPGRIP1L, CEP290, CC2D2A, DFNB31, and RAB11B for further assessment as potential genetic modifiers of XLPRA1. No correlation was found between the haplotypes and disease severity. During mutational analysis, several new variants, including a single intronic mutation in RAB8A and three mutations in exon 3 of DFNB31 were described (c.970G>A (V324I), c.978T>C (G326=), and c.985G>A (A329T)). Expression analysis of stress response genes in 16-week-old predisease XLPRA1 retinas revealed upregulation of GFAP but not HSPA5, DDIT3, HSPA4, HSP90B1, or HIF1A. Western blot analysis confirmed GFAP upregulation. In the same predisease group, no significant differences were found in the expression of 18 selected genes (RHO, OPN1LW, OPN1MW, RLBP1, RPGRORF15, RAB8A, RPGRIP1L, CEP290, CC2D2A, DFNB31, RAB11B, CRX, RCVRN, PVALB, CALB1, FGFR1, NTRK2, and NTRK3) involved in neuronal function.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Lack of association between haplotypes of RAB8A, RPGRIP1L, CEP290, CC2D2A, DFNB31, and RAB11B and the disease phenotype suggests that these genes are not genetic modifiers of XLPRA1. Upregulation of GFAP, an established indicator of the Müller cell gliosis, manifests as an important early feature of the disease."
Apoptosis Genes as a Key to Identification of Inverse Comorbidity of Huntington's Disease and Cancer,37298337,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37298337,"Cancer and neurodegenerative disorders present overwhelming challenges for healthcare worldwide. Epidemiological studies showed a decrease in cancer rates in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, including the Huntington disease (HD). Apoptosis is one of the most important processes for both cancer and neurodegeneration. We suggest that genes closely connected with apoptosis and associated with HD may affect carcinogenesis. We applied reconstruction and analysis of gene networks associated with HD and apoptosis and identified potentially important genes for inverse comorbidity of cancer and HD. The top 10 high-priority candidate genes included 
APOE
, 
PSEN1
, 
INS
, 
IL6
, 
SQSTM1
, 
SP1
, 
HTT
, 
LEP
, 
HSPA4
, and 
BDNF.
 Functional analysis of these genes was carried out using gene ontology and KEGG pathways. By exploring genome-wide association study results, we identified genes associated with neurodegenerative and oncological disorders, as well as their endophenotypes and risk factors. We used publicly available datasets of HD and breast and prostate cancers to analyze the expression of the identified genes. Functional modules of these genes were characterized according to disease-specific tissues. This integrative approach revealed that these genes predominantly exert similar functions in different tissues. Apoptosis along with lipid metabolism dysregulation and cell homeostasis maintenance in the response to environmental stimulus and drugs are likely key processes in inverse comorbidity of cancer in patients with HD. Overall, the identified genes represent the promising targets for studying molecular relations of cancer and HD."
Expression of heat shock proteins in periapical granulomas,24862711,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24862711,"Introduction:
        

      
      Cells from virtually all organisms respond to a variety of stresses by the rapid synthesis of a highly conserved set of polypeptides termed heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs protect cells under adverse conditions such as infection, inflammation, and disease. We hypothesize that endodontic infection might result in an imbalance in the expression of heat shock genes, accounting for different clinical outcomes in periapical lesions.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      We analyzed the expression of 44 HSPs genes using a pathway-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction array in 93 human periapical granulomas and 24 healthy periodontal ligament tissues collected postoperatively. Observed variations in the expression of HSP genes were also analyzed based on the classification of periapical granulomas as active or inactive. In addition, U937 cells were differentiated into macrophages, infected with different concentrations of purified Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and used as templates for the HSP gene array. Protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry.
    





          Results:
        

      
      The expression of HSP genes was significantly increased in granulomas compared with healthy periodontal ligament (P < .00001). Among the 44 HSP genes, DNAJC3, HSPA4, HSPA6, and HSPB1 showed the highest expression levels in both granulomas and LPS-treated macrophages. DNAJC3, HSPA6, and HSPB1 were highly expressed in active lesions, whereas HSPA4 expression was higher in inactive lesions (P < .005). Higher concentrations of LPS led to increased HSP expression in macrophages (P < .0001). Immunocytochemistry confirmed the expression and colocalization of HSPB1 and HSPA6 proteins in the cytoplasm of LPS-infected macrophages.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      The observed differential expression patterns of HSPs in periapical granulomas and LPS-infected macrophages suggest that HSP genes and proteins are involved in periapical lesion development and may account for different clinical outcomes. Understanding the role of the heat shock response might provide additional insights into the process of periapical lesion development."
Ischemia-responsive protein (irp94) gene expression in neurons,17913078,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17913078,"An increased expression of the ischemia-responsive protein gene (irp94) was detected in a Mongolian gerbil brain after an ischemic injury, particularly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In a rat phaeochromocytoma tumour cell line (PC12 cells), actinomycin D blocked the irp94 gene expression but cycloheximide did not. This indicates that irp94 gene expression is transcriptionally controlled. The half-life of irp94 mRNA was estimated to be approx. 5 h using 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB). In addition, irp94 expression was enhanced by either endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-inducible drugs or protease inhibitors. This suggests that irp94 gene expression is strongly associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR) in neurons."
Effect of tannic acid on doxorubicin-induced cellular stress: Expression levels of heat shock genes in rat spleen,38945802,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38945802,"Doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline group antibiotic, has been extensively employed as a potent chemotherapeutic agent for treating solid and hematopoietic tumors in humans. Amid exposure to diverse stress conditions, living organisms swiftly initiate the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs), a set of highly conserved proteins. Tannic acid (TA) has garnered increasing study attention due to its special chemical properties, health benefits, and wide availability. This study's primary aim is to elucidate the impact of DOX and TA on the expression levels of Hsp90aa1, Hspa1a, Hspa4, and Hspa5 in the spleen tissues of rats. Sprague Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus, male, 9-10 weeks old, 180 ± 20 g) were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, DOX (30 mg/kg cumulative), TA (50 mg/kg), and DOX + TA (5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, respectively). Subsequently, spleen tissues were collected from rats, and complementary DNA libraries were generated after the application process. The quantitative real-time PCR method was used to detect and quantify the mRNA expression changes of the Hsp90aa1, Hspa1a, Hspa4, and Hspa5 genes our results showed that the mRNA expressions of the targeted genes were up-regulated in rat spleen tissues exposed to DOX. However, this increase was remarkably suppressed by TA treatment. These findings suggest that TA may serve as a protective agent, mitigating the toxic effects of DOX in the rat spleen."
Role of CCT4/ErbB signaling in nephroblastoma: Implications for a biomarker of Wilms tumor,37058032,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37058032,"Wilms tumor is a common abdominal malignant tumor in children. However, the molecular mechanism of Wilms tumor is unclear. GSE66405 and GSE197047 were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Wilms tumor, the R package ""limma"" was used. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed to identify the significant module. The list of DEGs was input into the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database to construct a protein-protein interaction network for predicting core genes. Gene Ontology analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis are computational methods for assessing gene function and biological pathways. The genome was analyzed by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and developed by gene set enrichment analysis. Comparative Toxicogenomics Database analysis was performed to find the diseases most related to the core genes. TargetScan was used to screen for miRNAs that regulate hub genes. A total of 925 DEGs were identified. The differently expressed genes were mainly enriched in the metabolic pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, mRNA detection pathway, and folded protein binding. A total of 16 core genes (HNRNPK, PABPC1, HNRNPD, NCL, YBX1, EIF4G1, KHDRBS1, HNRNPAB, HSPA4, EEF2, HSP90AA1, EEF1A1, A TP5A1, SDHA, CCT4, CCT5) were obtained. chaperonin containing TCP-1 subunit 4 (CCT4) was downregulated in tumor tissue samples, which may have reverse regulatory significance for Wilms tumor. CCT4, HSP90AA1, NCL, PABPC1, and YBX1 were found to be associated with kidney disease, acute kidney injury, edema, tumor metastasis, transitional cell carcinoma, necrosis, and inflammation. The research found that the related miRNA of the CCT4 gene was hsamiR-7-5p. CCT4 might play an essential role in the occurrence and development of Wilms tumor, and they may participate in the occurrence and development of Wilms tumor through the ERBB signal pathway. CCT4 may be a promising biomarker of Wilms tumor."
Protein-protein interactions underlying the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and Alzheimer's disease,31951614,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31951614,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder currently affecting 45 million people worldwide, ranking as the 6th highest cause of death. Throughout the development and progression of AD, over 90% of patients display behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), with some of these symptoms occurring before memory deficits and therefore serving as potential early predictors of AD-related cognitive decline. However, the biochemical links between AD and BPSD are not known. In this study, we explored the molecular interactions between AD and BPSD using protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks built from OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) genes that were related to AD and two distinct BPSD domains, the Affective Domain and the Hyperactivity, Impulsivity, Disinhibition, and Aggression (HIDA) Domain. Our results yielded 8 unique proteins for the Affective Domain (RHOA, GRB2, PIK3R1, HSPA4, HSP90AA1, GSK3beta, PRKCZ, and FYN), 5 unique proteins for the HIDA Domain (LRP1, EGFR, YWHAB, SUMO1, and EGR1), and 6 shared proteins between both BPSD domains (APP, UBC, ELAV1, YWHAZ, YWHAE, and SRC) and AD. These proteins might suggest specific targets and pathways that are involved in the pathogenesis of these BPSD domains in AD."
Prion protein is associated with a worse prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,33896033,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33896033,"Background:
        

      
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) etiopathogenesis remains unclear, and the biological changes with the activation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and prion protein (PRNP) promoted by hypoxia in HNSC are undetermined. This study investigates hypoxia's effect in lymph node metastasis by PRNP expression changes and its main partners.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      The study combined a theoretical/cell culture study with a case-control study. First, bioinformatics and cell culture were performed. A case-control study was performed in a second step by comparing HNSC patients with and without lymph node metastasis.
    





          Analyses:
        

      
      The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data source validates the theory in the global population study.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Bioinformatics analysis suggests that hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1A) is associated with HSPA4, HSP90AA1 and PRNP expression. TCGA data validate the hypothesis that higher HSP90AA1, HSPA4 and PRNP are related to metastases and low survival. Herein, the cell study demonstrated that muted PRNP did not respond to hypoxia.
    





          Discussion:
        

      
      Our results collectively provide the first evidence that PRNP promotes HNSC lymph node metastasis progression through the upregulation of HSPA4, HSP90AA1 and HIF1A. Our findings may provide a molecular basis for the promoting Role of PRNP in HNSC progression."
NGS study of glucocorticoid response genes in inflammatory bowel disease patients,33747278,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33747278,"Introduction:
        

      
      Despite intensive research and a long history of glucocorticoids being applied in various clinical areas, they still generate a challenge for personalized medicine by causing resistance or dependence in nearly 50% of patients treated. The objective of the present study was to determine the genetic predictors of variable reactions in inflammatory bowel disease patients to glucocorticoid therapy. Therefore, based on the current knowledge on how glucocorticoids act, we have compiled a panel of 21 genes for variant analysis:

          Results:
        

      
      Analysis of all the targeted DNA sequences for the whole patient group indicated 121 different functional variants. After association analyses of 31 selected variants, the polymorphism c.1088A>G in the 
NR3C1
 gene was linked with glucocorticoid resistance (
p
 = 0.002), variant c.241+6A>G of the 
FKBP5

p
 = 0.034).
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Among the 21 analyzed genes, four (
NR3C1
, 
FKBP5
, 
MAPK14
, and 
ABCB1

Regulation of Human Hsc70 ATPase and Chaperone Activities by Apg2: Role of the Acidic Subdomain,30521813,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30521813,"Protein aggregate reactivation in metazoans is accomplished by the combined activity of Hsp70, Hsp40 and Hsp110 chaperones. Hsp110s support the refolding of aggregated polypeptides acting as specialized nucleotide exchange factors of Hsp70. We have studied how Apg2, one of the three human Hsp110s, regulates the activity of Hsc70 (HspA8), the constitutive Hsp70 in our cells. Apg2 shows a biphasic behavior: at low concentration, it stimulates the ATPase cycle of Hsc70, binding of the chaperone to protein aggregates and the refolding activity of the system, while it inhibits these three processes at high concentration. When the acidic subdomain of Apg2, a characteristic sequence present in the substrate binding domain of all Hsp110s, is deleted, the detrimental effects occur at lower concentration and are more pronounced, which concurs with an increase in the affinity of the Apg2 mutant for Hsc70. Our data support a mechanism in which Apg2 arrests the chaperone cycle through an interaction with Hsc70(ATP) that might lead to premature ATP dissociation before hydrolysis. In this line, the acidic subdomain might serve as a conformational switch to support dissociation of the Hsc70:Apg2 complex."
Gene Expression Characteristics of Tumor and Adjacent Non-Tumor Tissues of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) In-Silico,35891953,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35891953,"Background:
        

      
      One of the deadliest and most prevalent cancer is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Microarray has become an important tool in the research of PDAC genes and target therapeutic drugs.
    





          Objectives:
        

      
      This study intends to clarify the promising prognostic and biomarker targets in PDAC using GSE78229 and GSE62452 datasets, publicly accessible at the Gene Expression Omnibus database.
    





          Materials and methods:
        

      
      Utilizing GEOquery, Bio base, gplots, and ggplot2 packages in the R program, this study detects 428 differentially expressed genes that are further applied to build a co-expression network by the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). The turquoise module presented a higher correlation with PDAC progression. 79 candidate genes were selected based on the co-expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. In addition, the functional enrichment analysis was studied.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Five significant KEGG pathways linked to PDAC were detected, in which the endoplasmic reticulum protein processing pathway was remarked to be vital. The resulting 19 hub genes as HSPA4, PABPC1, HSP90B1, PPP1CC, USP9X, EIF2S3, MSN, RAB10, BMPR2, P4HB, UBC, B2M, SLC25A5, MMP7, SPTBN1, RALB, DNAJB1, CENPE, and PDIA6 were identified by the Network Analyst web tool founded on PPI network by the STRING. These were identified as the most connected hub proteins. The quantification of the expression of levels and survival probabilities were analyzed overall survival (OS) of the real hub genes and were investigated by Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter through The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) database.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      The protein-protein interactions and KEGG pathway enrichment by DAVID indicated that some pathways were involved in PDAC, such as ""pathways in cancer (hsa05200)"", ""protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (hsa04141)"", ""antigen processing and presentation (hsa04612)"", ""dopaminergic synapse (hsa04728)"", and ""measles (hsa05162)""; in which these pathways, the ""protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (hsa04141)"", was further studied because of its closely relationship with PDAC. The rest of the hub genes reviewed throughout the study might be promising targets for diagnosing and treating PDAC and relevant diseases."
CEP55: Implications for Immunotherapy and Survival in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,38847172,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38847172,"Background:
        

      
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm that usually originates from liver cells and is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. To improve the survival rate of HCC patients, specific prognostic markers are essential to guide HCC therapy. CEP55 is a microtubule-bundling protein involved in critical cell functions, including cell growth, transformation, and cytokinesis.
    





          Aims:
        

      
      This study examined gene alterations in HCC tumor tissues through comprehensive analysis, aiming to elucidate their contribution to disease development.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Bioinformatics tools were employed to investigate the expression, genetic variations, prognostic significance, and clinicopathological relevance of CEP55 across GEO and TCGA datasets. We further explored gene alterations, DNA methylation levels, and immune infiltration of CEP55. To elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms involved, GO and KEGG analysis was performed. Finally, RT-qPCR was also performed on a number of normal and tumoral cell lines in vitro, which demonstrated that the expression of the CEP55 was significantly higher in the tumor cell lines.
    





          Results:
        

      
      We observed that CEP55 was upregulated in 16 cancers compared to corresponding normal tissues. CEP55 was found to be related to T stages, pathologic stages, histologic grade, and levels of AFP. K-M analysis demonstrated that CEP55 expression was associated with a worse outcome. ROC curve analysis showed that CEP55 expression accurately distinguished HCC from normal tissue (AUC = 0.954). The area under 1-,3- and 5-year survival ROCs were above 0.6. The HSPA4 genetic alterations in HCC were 0.8%. Among the 15 DNA methylation CpG sites, 6 were related to the prognosis of HCC. HSPA4 was positively related to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoints in HCC. The KEGG pathway analysis indicated that CEP55 was associated with the cell cycle and presented together with CDK1. HCC cell lines were demonstrated to express high levels of CEP55 compared to normal cells.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      As a result of bioinformatic analyses and RT-qPCR validation in HCC, CEP55 increased in HCC tissues and was associated with the stage of the disease and survival rate."
Functional diversity between HSP70 paralogs caused by variable interactions with specific co-chaperones,32284329,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32284329,"Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) chaperones play a central role in protein quality control and are crucial for many cellular processes, including protein folding, degradation, and disaggregation. Human HSP70s compose a family of 13 members that carry out their functions with the aid of even larger families of co-chaperones. A delicate interplay between HSP70s and co-chaperone recruitment is thought to determine substrate fate, yet it has been generally assumed that all Hsp70 paralogs have similar activities and are largely functionally redundant. However, here we found that when expressed in human cells, two highly homologous HSP70s, HSPA1A and HSPA1L, have opposing effects on cellular handling of various substrates. For example, HSPA1A reduced aggregation of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated protein variant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-A4V, whereas HSPA1L enhanced its aggregation. Intriguingly, variations in the substrate-binding domain of these HSP70s did not play a role in this difference. Instead, we observed that substrate fate is determined by differential interactions of the HSP70s with co-chaperones. Whereas most co-chaperones bound equally well to these two HSP70s, Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (HOP) preferentially bound to HSPA1L, and the Hsp110 nucleotide-exchange factor HSPH2 preferred HSPA1A. The role of HSPH2 was especially crucial for the HSPA1A-mediated reduction in SOD1-A4V aggregation. These findings reveal a remarkable functional diversity at the level of the cellular HSP70s and indicate that this diversity is defined by their affinities for specific co-chaperones such as HSPH2."
Sequence and expression analysis of HSP70 family genes in Artemia franciscana,31182775,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31182775,"Thus far, only one gene from the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family has been identified in Artemia franciscana. Here, we used the draft Artemia transcriptome database to search for other genes in the HSP70 family. Four novel HSP70 genes were identified and designated heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70), heat shock 70 kDa cognate 5 (HSC70-5), Immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BIP), and hypoxia up-regulated protein 1 (HYOU1). For each of these genes, we obtained nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, and reconstructed a phylogenetic tree. Expression analysis revealed that in the juvenile state, the transcription of HSP70 and HSC70 was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in a population of A. franciscana selectively bred for increased induced thermotolerance (TF12) relative to a control population (CF12). Following non-lethal heat shock treatment at the nauplius stage, transcription of HSP70, HSC70, and HSC70-5 were significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated in TF12. In contrast, transcription of the other HSP70 family members in A. franciscana (BIP, HYOU1, and HSPA4) showed no significant (P > 0.05) induction. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that not all members of the HSP70 family are involved in the response to heat stress and selection and that especially altered expression of HSC70 plays a role in a population selected for increased thermotolerance."
Upregulation of HSPA1A/HSPA1B/HSPA7 and Downregulation of HSPA9 Were Related to Poor Survival in Colon Cancer,34765552,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34765552,"The human HSP70 family is a type of heat shock protein (HSP), consisting of 13 members encoded by the HSPA genes. HSPs play important roles in regulating cellular responses and functions during carcinogenesis, but their relationship with colon cancer is unclear. In our study, we found that the expressions of HSPA1B, HSPA4, HSPA5, HSPA6, HSPA8, HSPA9, HSPA13, and HSPA14 were significantly increased, while those of HSPA1A, HSPA2, HSPA7, and HSPA12B were significantly decreased in colon cancer tissues. The expression of HSPA gene family members was associated with some clinicopathological characteristics, including age, gender, TNM stage, pathological stage, and CEA level. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis showed that high HSPA1A, HSPA1B, and HSPA7 expressions were related to unfavorable survival, and high HSPA9 was associated with favorable survival. The relationships between HSPA1A and HSPA9 expression and survival were validated in the GEO dataset, and the HSPA1A and HSPA9 protein expression differences between colon cancer tissues and normal tissues were validated in the UALCAN database. Methylation of HSPA1A and HSPA9 was also analyzed, and it was found that the methylation of the HSPA1A promoter was significantly increased, and the methylation of the HSPA9 promoter was significantly decreased in colon cancer tissues. Increasing the methylation level of the HSPA1A gene and decreasing the methylation level of HSPA9 were related to favorable prognosis. The expression difference of HSPA1A/HSPA1B/HSPA7/HSPA9 was verified in colon cancer cell lines and colonic epithelial cells. Gene ontology analysis was used to screen signal pathways related to HSPA1A-, HSPA1B-, HSPA7-, and HSPA9- high phenotype. In summary, the increased expressions of HSPA1A1, HSPA1B, and HSPA7 were associated with poor prognosis, while that of HSPA9 was related to favorable prognosis for colon cancer patients."
Machine Learning for Building Immune Genetic Model in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients,33790969,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33790969,"Background:
        

      
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading liver cancer with special immune microenvironment, which played vital roles in tumor relapse and poor drug responses. In this study, we aimed to explore the prognostic immune signatures in HCC and tried to construct an immune-risk model for patient evaluation.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      RNA sequencing profiles of HCC patients were collected from the cancer genome Atlas (TCGA), international cancer genome consortium (ICGC), and gene expression omnibus (GEO) databases (GSE14520). Differentially expressed immune genes, derived from ImmPort database and MSigDB signaling pathway lists, between tumor and normal tissues were analyzed with Limma package in 
R
 environment. Univariate Cox regression was performed to find survival-related immune genes in TCGA dataset, and in further random forest algorithm analysis, significantly changed immune genes were used to generate a multivariate Cox model to calculate the corresponding immune-risk score. The model was examined in the other two datasets with recipient operation curve (ROC) and survival analysis. Risk effects of immune-risk score and clinical characteristics of patients were individually evaluated, and significant factors were then used to generate a nomogram.
    





          Results:
        

      
      There were 52 downregulated and 259 upregulated immune genes between tumor and relatively normal tissues, and the final immune-risk model (based on SPP1, BRD8, NDRG1, KITLG, HSPA4, TRAF3, ITGAV and MAP4K2) can better differentiate patients into high and low immune-risk subpopulations, in which high score patients showed worse outcomes after resection (
p
 < 0.05). The differentially enriched pathways between the two groups were mainly about cell proliferation and cytokine production, and calculated immune-risk score was also highly correlated with immune infiltration levels. The nomogram, constructed with immune-risk score and tumor stages, showed high accuracy and clinical benefits in prediction of 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival, which is useful in clinical practice.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      The immune-risk model, based on expression of SPP1, BRD8, NDRG1, KITLG, HSPA4, TRAF3, ITGAV, and MAP4K2, can better differentiate patients into high and low immune-risk groups. Combined nomogram, using immune-risk score and tumor stages, could make accurate prediction of 1-, 3- and 5-year survival in HCC patients."

Molecular association of pathogenetic contributors to pre-eclampsia (pre-eclampsia associome),25879409,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25879409,"Background:
        

      
      Pre-eclampsia is the most common complication occurring during pregnancy. In the majority of cases, it is concurrent with other pathologies in a comorbid manner (frequent co-occurrences in patients), such as diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes and obesity. Providing bronchial asthma, pulmonary tuberculosis, certain neurodegenerative diseases and cancers as examples, we have shown previously that pairs of inversely comorbid pathologies (rare co-occurrences in patients) are more closely related to each other at the molecular genetic level compared with randomly generated pairs of diseases. Data in the literature concerning the causes of pre-eclampsia are abundant. However, the key mechanisms triggering this disease that are initiated by other pathological processes are thus far unknown. The aim of this work was to analyse the characteristic features of genetic networks that describe interactions between comorbid diseases, using pre-eclampsia as a case in point.
    





          Results:
        

      
      The use of ANDSystem, Pathway Studio and STRING computer tools based on text-mining and database-mining approaches allowed us to reconstruct associative networks, representing molecular genetic interactions between genes, associated concurrently with comorbid disease pairs, including pre-eclampsia, diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes and obesity. It was found that these associative networks statistically differed in the number of genes and interactions between them from those built for randomly chosen pairs of diseases. The associative network connecting all four diseases was composed of 16 genes (PLAT, ADIPOQ, ADRB3, LEPR, HP, TGFB1, TNFA, INS, CRP, CSRP1, IGFBP1, MBL2, ACE, ESR1, SHBG, ADA). Such an analysis allowed us to reveal differential gene risk factors for these diseases, and to propose certain, most probable, theoretical mechanisms of pre-eclampsia development in pregnant women. The mechanisms may include the following pathways: [TGFB1 or TNFA]-[IL1B]-[pre-eclampsia]; [TNFA or INS]-[NOS3]-[pre-eclampsia]; [INS]-[HSPA4 or CLU]-[pre-eclampsia]; [ACE]-[MTHFR]-[pre-eclampsia].
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      For pre-eclampsia, diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes and obesity, we showed that the size and connectivity of the associative molecular genetic networks, which describe interactions between comorbid diseases, statistically exceeded the size and connectivity of those built for randomly chosen pairs of diseases. Recently, we have shown a similar result for inversely comorbid diseases. This suggests that comorbid and inversely comorbid diseases have common features concerning structural organization of associative molecular genetic networks."
Identification of a five-immune gene model as an independent prognostic factor in hepatocellular carcinoma,33726698,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33726698,"Background:
        

      
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor with a poor prognosis. We aimed to identify a new prognostic model of HCC based on differentially expressed (DE) immune genes.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      The DE immune genes were identified based on an analysis of 374 cases of HCC and 50 adjacent non-tumor specimens from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Univariate Cox analysis, Lasso regression, and multivariate Cox analysis were used to construct the model based on the training group. Survival analysis and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate model performance. The testing group and the entire group were subsequently used for validation of the model.
    





          Results:
        

      
      A five-immune gene model consisted of HSPA4, ISG20L2, NDRG1, EGF, and IL17D was identified. Based on the model, the overall survival was significantly different between the high-risk and low-risk groups (P = 7.953e-06). The AUCs for the model at 1- and 3-year were 0.849 and 0.74, respectively. The reliability of the model was confirmed using the validation groups. The risk score was identified as an independent prognostic parameter and closely related to the content of immune cells from human HCC specimens.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      We identified a five-immune gene model that can be used as an independent prognostic marker for HCC."
Bioinformatics Analysis of Common Genetic and Molecular Traits and Association of Portal Hypertension with Pulmonary Hypertension,36312597,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36312597,"Portal hypertension (PH) is an important cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension(PAH), but its mechanism is still unclear. We used genetic data analysis to explore the shared genes and molecular mechanisms of PH and PAH. We downloaded the PH and PAH data from the GEO database, and used the weighted gene coexpression network analysis method (WGCNA) to analyze the coexpression modules of idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) and cirrhotic portal hypertension (CPH) and pulmonary hypertension, respectively. Enrichment analysis was performed on the common genes, and differential gene expressions (DEGs) were used for verification. The target genes of INCPH and PAH were obtained by string and cytoscape software, and the miRNAs of target genes were predicted by miRwalk, miRDB, and TargetScan and their biological functions were analyzed; finally, we used PanglaoDB to predict the expression of target genes in cells. In WGCNA, gene modules significantly related to PAH, CPH, and INCPH were identified, and enrichment function analysis showed that the common pathway of PAH and CPH were ""P53 signaling pathway,"" ""synthesis of neutral lipids""; PAH and INCPH are ""terminal,"" ""Maintenance Regulation of Granules,"" and ""Toxin Transport."" DEGs confirmed the results of WGCNA; the common miRNA functions of PAH and cirrhosis were enriched for ""P53 signaling pathway,"" ""TGF-
β
 signaling pathway,"" ""TNF signaling pathway,"" and ""fatty acid metabolism,"" and the miRNAs-mRNAs network suggested that hsa-miR-22a-3p regulates MDM2 and hsa-miR-34a-5p regulates PRDX4; the target genes of PAH and INCPH are EIF5B, HSPA4, GNL3, RARS, UTP20, HNRNPA2B1, HSP90B1, METAP2, NARS, SACM1L, and their target miRNA function enrichment showed EIF5B, HNRNPA2B1, HSP90B1, METAP2, NARS, SACM1L, and HSPA4 are associated with telomeres and inflammation, panglaoDB showed that target genes are located in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, etc. In conclusion, the mechanism of pulmonary hypertension induced by portal hypertension may be related to telomere dysfunction and P53 overactivation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal inflammation are also involved in this process."
Epigenetic rewiring of pathways related to odour perception in immune cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in vivo and in vitro,35758003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35758003,"A majority of SARS-CoV-2 recoverees develop only mild-to-moderate symptoms, while some remain completely asymptomatic. Although viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, may evade host immune responses by epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, little is known about whether these modifications are important in defence against and healthy recovery from COVID-19 in the host. To this end, epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns from COVID-19 convalescents were compared to uninfected controls from before and after the pandemic. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA was extracted from uninfected controls, COVID-19 convalescents, and symptom-free individuals with SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell-responses, as well as from PBMCs stimulated 
in vitro
 with SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, the Illumina MethylationEPIC 850K array was performed, and statistical/bioinformatic analyses comprised differential DNA methylation, pathway over-representation, and module identification analyses. Differential DNA methylation patterns distinguished COVID-19 convalescents from uninfected controls, with similar results in an experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection model. A SARS-CoV-2-induced module was identified 
in vivo
, comprising 66 genes of which six (
TP53, INS, HSPA4, SP1, ESR1,
 and 
FAS
) were present in corresponding 
in vitro
 analyses. Over-representation analyses revealed involvement in Wnt, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor signalling, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor pathways. Furthermore, numerous differentially methylated and network genes from both settings interacted with the SARS-CoV-2 interactome. Altered DNA methylation patterns of COVID-19 convalescents suggest recovery from mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection leaves longstanding epigenetic traces. Both 
in vitro
 and 
in vivo
 exposure caused epigenetic modulation of pathways thataffect odour perception. Future studies should determine whether this reflects host-induced protective antiviral defense or targeted viral hijacking to evade host defence."
"Differentially Expressed Cell Cycle Genes and STAT1/3-Driven Multiple Cancer Entanglement in Psoriasis, Coupled with Other Comorbidities",36497125,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36497125,"Psoriasis is a persistent T-cell-supported inflammatory cutaneous disorder, which is defined by a significant expansion of basal cells in the epidermis. Cell cycle and STAT genes that control cell cycle progression and viral infection have been revealed to be comorbid with the development of certain cancers and other disorders, due to their abnormal or scanty expression. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the expression of certain cell cycle and STAT1/3 genes in psoriasis patients and to determine the types of comorbidities associated with these genes. To do so, we opted to adopt the in silico methodology, since it is a quick and easy way to discover any potential comorbidity risks that may exist in psoriasis patients. With the genes collected from early research groups, protein networks were created in this work using the NetworkAnalyst program. The crucial hub genes were identified by setting the degree parameter, and they were then used in gene ontology and pathway assessments. The transcription factors that control the hub genes were detected by exploring TRRUST, and DGIdb was probed for remedies that target transcription factors and hubs. Using the degree filter, the first protein subnetwork produced seven hub genes, including STAT3, CCNB1, STAT1, CCND1, CDC20, HSPA4, and MAD2L1. The hub genes were shown to be implicated in cell cycle pathways by the gene ontology and Reactome annotations. The former four hubs were found in signaling pathways, including prolactin, FoxO, JAK/STAT, and p53, according to the KEGG annotation. Furthermore, they enhanced several malignancies, including pancreatic cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. Viral infections, including measles, hepatitis C, Epstein-Barr virus, and HTLV-1 and viral carcinogenesis were among the other susceptible diseases. Diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease were conjointly annotated. In total, 129 medicines were discovered in DGIdb to be effective against the transcription factors BRCA1, RELA, TP53, and MYC, as opposed to 10 medications against the hubs, STAT3 and CCND1, in tandem with 8 common medicines. The study suggests that the annotated medications should be tested in suitable psoriatic cell lines and animal models to optimize the drugs used based on the kind, severity, and related comorbidities of psoriasis. Furthermore, a personalized medicine protocol must be designed for each psoriasis patient that displays different comorbidities."
Epigenetic Biomarkers Screening of Non-Coding RNA and DNA Methylation Based on Peripheral Blood Monocytes in Smokers,35233217,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35233217,"This study aims to use bioinformatics methods to determine the epigenetic changes in microRNA expression and DNA methylation caused by cigarette smoking. The data of mRNA, miRNA expression, and methylation microarray were obtained from the GEO database to filter differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), and methylated CpG probes (DMPs) through the limma package. The R clusterProfile package was used for functional annotation and enrichment analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by the String database and visualized in Cytoscape software. Starbase database was employed to predict lncRNA and CirRNA based on the sequence of miRNA, and to establish a regulatory network of ceRNA. By overlapping DEG and DEM, 107 down-miRNA-targeted up-regulated genes and 65 up-miRNA-target down-regulated genes were obtained, which were mainly enriched in autophagy signaling pathways and protein ubiquitination pathways, respectively. In addition, 324 genes with low methylation and high expression and 204 genes with high methylation and low expression were respectively related to the degeneration of the nervous system and the function of the cardiovascular system. Interestingly, 43 genes were up-regulated under the dual regulation of reduced miRNA and hypomethylation, while 14 genes were down-regulated under the dual regulation of increased miRNA and hypermethylation. Ten chemicals have been identified as putative therapeutic agents for pathological conditions caused by smoking. In addition, among these genes, HSPA4, GRB2, PRKCA, and BCL2L1 could play a fundamental role in related diseases caused by smoking and may be used as the biomarkers for precise diagnosis and targets for future therapies of smoking-related diseases."
Identification of candidate genomic regions for egg yolk moisture content based on a genome-wide association study,36918797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36918797,"Background:
        

      
      Eggs represent important sources of protein and are widely loved by consumers. Egg yolk taste is an important index for egg selection, and the moisture content of the egg yolk affects the taste. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying egg yolk moisture content, this study determined the phenotype and heritability of egg yolk water content and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a mixed linear model.
    





          Results:
        

      
      We determined the phenotype and heritability of thermogelled egg yolk water content (TWC) and found that the average TWC was 47.73%. Moreover, significant variations occurred (41.06-57.12%), and the heritability was 0.11, which indicates medium-low heritability. Through the GWAS, 48 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to TWC (20 significantly, 28 suggestively) were obtained, and they were mainly located on chromosomes 10 and 13. We identified 36 candidate genes based on gene function and found that they were mainly involved in regulating fat, protein, and water content and embryonic development. FGF9, PIAS1, FEM1B, NOX5, GLCE, VDAC1, IGFBP7, and THOC5 were involved in lipid formation and regulation; AP3S2, GNPDA1, HSPA4, AP1B1, CABP7, EEF1D, SYTL3, PPP2CA, SKP1, and UBE2B were involved in protein folding and hydrolysis; and CSF2, SOWAHA, GDF9, FSTL4, RAPGEF6, PAQR5, and ZMAT5 were related to embryonic development and egg production. Moreover, MICU2, ITGA11, WDR76, BLM, ANPEP, TECRL, EWSR1, and P4HA2 were related to yolk quality, while ITGA11, WDR76, BLM, and ANPEP were potentially significantly involved in egg yolk water content and thus deserve further attention and research. In addition, this study identified a 19.31-19.92 Mb genome region on GGA10, and a linkage disequilibrium analysis identified strong correlations within this region. Thus, GGA10 may represent a candidate region for TWC traits.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      The molecular genetic mechanism involved in TWC was revealed through heritability measurements and GWAS, which identified a series of SNPs, candidate genes, and candidate regions related to TWC. These results provide insights on the molecular mechanism of egg yolk moisture content and may aid in the development of new egg traits."
"Evaluation of the Genetic Diversity, Population Structure and Selection Signatures of Three Native Chinese Pig Populations",37370521,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37370521,"Indigenous pig populations in Hainan Province live in tropical climate conditions and a relatively closed geographical environment, which has contributed to the formation of some excellent characteristics, such as heat tolerance, strong disease resistance and excellent meat quality. Over the past few decades, the number of these pig populations has decreased sharply, largely due to a decrease in growth rate and poor lean meat percentage. For effective conservation of these genetic resources (such as heat tolerance, meat quality and disease resistance), the whole-genome sequencing data of 78 individuals from 3 native Chinese pig populations, including Wuzhishan (WZS), Tunchang (TC) and Dingan (DA), were obtained using a 150 bp paired-end platform, and 25 individuals from two foreign breeds, including Landrace (LR) and Large White (LW), were downloaded from a public database. A total of 28,384,282 SNPs were identified, of which 27,134,233 SNPs were identified in native Chinese pig populations. Both genetic diversity statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis indicated that indigenous pig populations displayed high genetic diversity. The result of population structure implied the uniqueness of each native Chinese pig population. The selection signatures were detected between indigenous pig populations and foreign breeds by using the population differentiation index (

Hu-Zhang-Qing-Mai-Yin Inhibits Proliferation of Human Retinal Capillary Endothelial Cells Exposed to High Glucose,34421625,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34421625,"Background:
        

      
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the serious complications of diabetes and an important cause of blindness. Despite much research on the pathogenesis of DR, there is still a lack of safe and effective treatment methods. Hu-zhang-qing-mai-yin (HZQMY), a Chinese medicine formula, has been clinically used in the safe and effective treatment of DR for many years. However, the systematic pharmacological research is lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-DR effects of HZQMY and explore the possible mechanism involved.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      The constituents of HZQMY were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. DR model was established by high glucose simulation on human retinal capillary endothelial cells (HRCECs) 
in vitro
. The cell viability, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and tube formation were assessed. Subsequently the related mechanisms were analyzed by assays for JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), intracellular ROS, ATP, western blot and proteomics.
    





          Results:
        

      
      27 main chemical components contained in HZQMY were identified. HZQMY significantly inhibited the viability and proliferation of HRCECs exposed to high glucose, and promoted the apoptosis. In addition, HZQMY also boosted the release of ROS and suppressed tube formation of HRCECs under high glucose exposure. Meanwhile, HRCECs treated with high glucose released more ROS than normal cells, which could be markedly inhibited by HZQMY in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, western blot assay indicated that HZQMY increased the expression of proteins related to the P38 signaling pathway and inhibited nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway. Proteomic analysis predicted that HSPA4, MAPK3, ENO1, EEF2 and ERPS may be the candidate targets of HZQMY in HRCECs.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      HZQMY inhibited the proliferation and promoted the Mitochondria related apoptosis of HRCECs exposed to high glucose possibly through regulating P38 and NF-κB signaling pathway."
Analysis of PPI networks of transcriptomic expression identifies hub genes associated with Newcastle disease virus persistent infection in bladder cancer,37147328,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37147328,"Bladder cancer cells can acquire persistent infection of oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) but the molecular mechanism(s) remain unelucidated. This poses a major barrier to the effective clinical translation of oncolytic NDV virotherapy of cancers. To improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) associated with the development of NDV persistent infection in bladder cancer, we used mRNA expression profiles of persistently infected bladder cancer cells to construct PPI networks. Based on paths and modules in the PPI network, the bridges were found mainly in the upregulated mRNA-pathways of p53 signalling, ECM-receptor interaction, and TGF-beta signalling and downregulated mRNA-pathways of antigen processing and presentation, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, completement and coagulation cascades in persistent TCCSUPPi cells. In persistent EJ28Pi cells, connections were identified mainly through upregulated mRNA-pathways of renal carcinoma, viral carcinogenesis, Ras signalling and cell cycle and the downregulated mRNA-pathways of Wnt signalling, HTLV-I infection and pathways in cancers. These connections were mainly dependent on RPL8-HSPA1A/HSPA4 in TCCSUPPi cells and EP300, PTPN11, RAC1-TP53, SP1, CCND1 and XPO1 in EJ28Pi cells. Oncomine validation showed that the top hub genes identified in the networks that include RPL8, THBS1, F2 from TCCSUPPi and TP53 and RAC1 from EJ28Pi are involved in the development and progression of bladder cancer. Protein-drug interaction networks identified several putative drug targets that could be used to disrupt the linkages between the modules and prevent bladder cancer cells from acquiring NDV persistent infection. This novel PPI network analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs of NDV persistently infected bladder cancer cell lines provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms of NDV persistency of infection in bladder cancers and the future screening of drugs that can be used together with NDV to enhance its oncolytic efficacy."
A Simplified and Effective Approach for the Isolation of Small Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived from Human Peripheral Blood,36979766,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36979766,"Pluripotent stem cells are key players in regenerative medicine. Embryonic pluripotent stem cells, despite their significant advantages, are associated with limitations such as their inadequate availability and the ethical dilemmas in their isolation and clinical use. The discovery of very small embryonic-like (VSEL) stem cells addressed the aforementioned limitations, but their isolation technique remains a challenge due to their small cell size and their efficiency in isolation. Here, we report a simplified and effective approach for the isolation of small pluripotent stem cells derived from human peripheral blood. Our approach results in a high yield of small blood stem cell (SBSC) population, which expresses pluripotent embryonic markers (e.g., Nanog, SSEA-3) and the Yamanaka factors. Further, a fraction of SBSCs also co-express hematopoietic markers (e.g., CD45 and CD90) and/or mesenchymal markers (e.g., CD29, CD105 and PTH1R), suggesting a mixed stem cell population. Finally, quantitative proteomic profiling reveals that SBSCs contain various stem cell markers (CD9, ITGA6, MAPK1, MTHFD1, STAT3, HSPB1, HSPA4), and Transcription reg complex factors (e.g., STAT5B, PDLIM1, ANXA2, ATF6, CAMK1). In conclusion, we present a novel, simplified and effective isolating process that yields an abundant population of small-sized cells with characteristics of pluripotency from human peripheral blood."
The expression profiles and prognostic values of HSPs family members in Head and neck cancer,32523426,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32523426,"Background:
        

      
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) ranks as the sixth most common malignancy. The identification of highly specific and sensitive prognostic markers and potential drug targets can contribute to enhanced patient prognosis and individualized treatments. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) act as molecular chaperones and play a crucial role in maintaining cell homeostasis. Recently, research has indicated that HSPs also act as ""evil chaperones"" in cancer development.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      In this study, we assessed the expression of HSPs in HNSC patients using the ONCOMINE, GEPIA, and UALCAN databases. Mutations of HSP genes were also analysed using the cBioPortal database. Additionally, the expression levels of HSPs were verified using the Human Protein Altas (THPA) database.
    





          Results:
        

      
      We found that the expression levels of HSPH1, HSPD1, SERPINH1, HSPA4, and HSP90AA1 were significantly higher in tissues from HNSC patients compared with normal tissues. Moreover, HSPH1, HSPD1, SERPINH1, HSPA4 and HSP90AA1 expressions were linked to disease progression. Survival analysis with the GEPIA and OncoLnc databases indicated that upregulation of HSPH1, HSPD1, SERPINH1, HSPA4 and HSP90AA1 was related to poor overall survival (OS).
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      This study suggests that the HSPH1, HSPD1, SERPINH1, HSPA4 and HSP90AA1 genes are potential clinical targets and prognostic biomarkers for patients with HNSC."
Zebrafish heat shock protein a4 genes in the intestinal epithelium are up-regulated during inflammation,21557452,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21557452,"A number of heat shock proteins (HSPs), including Hsp70 and Hsp110, function as molecular chaperones within intestinal epithelial cells that line the mammalian digestive system. HSPs confer cellular protection against environmental stress induced by chemical toxins or pathogens. There is interest in how members of this protein family might influence the progression of inflammatory bowel disease. Using the zebrafish model system, we report the expression of the duplicated hspa4 genes within the intestinal epithelium. The hspa4 genes belong to the Hsp110 family. We show that under inflammatory stress conditions within the gut, expression of these genes is up-regulated in a similar manner to that previously observed for mammalian Hsp70. Because of the amenability of the zebrafish to whole-animal screening protocols, the hspa4 genes could be used as effective read-outs for genetic, chemical and environmental factors that might influence intestinal inflammation."
"Inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress alleviates triple-negative breast cancer cell viability, migration, and invasion by Syntenin/SOX4/Wnt/β-catenin pathway via regulation of heat shock protein A4",35442158,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35442158,"Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) is a double-edged sword in the occurrence and development of malignant cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the roles of ER stress in metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transitionin triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and potential mechanisms. In this study, 4-PBA was administrated to inhibit the ER stress. Cell viability was evaluated using a cell counting kit-8 assay. Cell migration and invasion were identified by wound healing and transwell assay, respectively. Levels of MMP2 and MMP9 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical staining. Western blot assay was used to assess the levels of ER stress-related proteins, Syndecan-1 (SDC-1)/Syntenin-1 (SDCBP-1)/SRY-related HMG-box 4 (SOX4) signaling and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, a xenograft mice model was conducted to confirm the role of ER stress in TNBC. The data indicate that the ability of viability and metastasis of breast cancer cells were stronger than normal mammary epithelial cells. More aggressiveness was manifested in TNBC cells than that in non-TNBC cells. 4-PBA significantly suppressed the viability, migration, and invasion in BC cells and inhibited the SDC/SDCBP/SOX4 axis and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, heat shock protein A4 (HSPA4) overexpression stimulated ER stress and activated the SDC-1/SDCBP-1/SOX4 pathway and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Animal experiments showed similar results that 4-PBA repressed tumor growth and inactivated the two pathways, while HSPA4 overexpression reversed the effects of 4-PBA. In summary, inhibition of ER stress inhibited TNBC viability, migration, and invasion by Syntenin/SOX4/Wnt/β-catenin pathway via regulation of HSPA4 in vivo and in vitro."
A Bioinformatic Approach for the Identification of Molecular Determinants of Resistance/Sensitivity to Cancer Thermotherapy,31814876,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31814876,"Application of heat above 43°C and up to 47°C, the so-called ""thermal ablation"" range, leads to tumor cell destruction either by apoptosis or by necrosis. However, tumor cells have developed mechanisms of defense that render them thermoresistant. Of importance, the 
in situ
 application of heat for the treatment of localized solid tumors can also prime specific antitumor immunity. Herein, a bioinformatic approach was employed for the identification of molecular determinants implicated in thermoresistance and immunogenic cell death (ICD). To this end, both literature-derived (text mining) and microarray gene expression profile data were processed, followed by functional enrichment analysis. Two important functional gene modules were detected in hyperthermia resistance and ICD, the former including members of the heat shock protein (HSP) family of molecular chaperones and the latter including immune-related molecules, respectively. Of note, the molecules HSP90AA1 and HSPA4 were found common between thermoresistance and damage signaling molecules (damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)) and ICD. In addition, the prognostic potential of 
HSP90AA1
 and 
HSPA4
 overexpression for cancer patients' overall survival was investigated. The results of this study could constitute the basis for the strategic development of more efficient and personalized therapeutic strategies against cancer by means of thermotherapy, by taking into consideration the genetic profile of each patient."
Heat shock protein 70 protects the lungs from hyperoxic injury in a neonatal rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia,37200358,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37200358,"Hyperoxia plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of lung injury, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), in premature infants or newborns. BPD management aims to minimize further injury, provide an optimal environment to support growth and recovery. In clinic neonatal care, we need a new therapy for BPD. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) inhibit cell apoptosis and promote cell repair allowing cells to survive lethal injury. We hypothesized that Hsp70 could be used to prevent hyperoxia related BPD in the neonatal rat model through its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we explored the effect of Hsp70 on hyperoxia-induced lung injury using neonatal rats. Neonatal Wistar rats were delivered naturally at full term of gestation and were then pooled and randomly assigned to several groups to receive heat stimulation (41°C for 20 min) or room temperature conditions. The Hsp70 group received recombinant Hsp70 intraperitoneally (200 μg/kg, daily). All newborn rats were placed under hyperoxic conditions (85% oxygen) for 21 days. Survival rates in both heat-hyperoxia and Hsp70-hyperoxia groups were higher than those in the hyperoxia group (p < 0.05). Both endogenous and exogenous Hsp70 could reduce early apoptosis of alveolar cells under hyperoxia. Additionally, there were less macrophage infiltration in the lung of the Hsp70 groups (p < 0.05). Heat stress, heat shock proteins, and exogenous recombinant Hsp70 significantly increased the survival rate and reduced pathological hyperoxia induced lung injuries in the development of BPD. These results suggest that treating hyperoxia-induced lung injury with Hsp70 may reduce the risk of developing BPD."
"Transcriptome analysis provides the first insight into the molecular basis of temperature plasticity in Banggai cardinalfish, Pterapogon kauderni",34479169,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34479169,"Banggai cardinalfish, Pterapogon kauderni, is a tropical fish listed as an endangered species by IUCN. Its distribution and survival condition are extremely limited, and the changes of living environment caused by global warming may seriously threaten its geographical distribution. In order to understand the survival temperature range and the potential mechanism of temperature plasticity of P. kauderni, transcriptome analysis was performed under five temperature conditions (18 °C, 22 °C, 26 °C, 30 °C and 34 °C). A total of 432,444,497 clean reads were obtained from the mix tissues of whole head, viscera (except intestine), and muscle. All clean data were spliced into 194,832 unigenes. Compared with 26 °C, 57, 107, 187 and 174 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained at 18 °C, 22 °C, 30 °C and 34 °C, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed the most highly enriched in the DEGs were cellular processes, binding, metabolic processes and biological regulation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated circadian rhythm, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, influenza A and prion disease were significantly enriched. 47 genes that may be related to temperature stress were identified, such as Per1, MLP, IGFBP1, HSP70, HSP90α, HSPA4, DNAJB1, CALR. This is the first RNA-Seq study of P. kauderni. This information should be valuable for further targeted studies on temperature tolerance, thereby assisting the protection and development of P. kauderni."
Human and yeast Hsp110 chaperones exhibit functional differences,16364315,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16364315,"Hsp110 proteins constitute a heterogeneous family of abundant molecular chaperones, related to the Hsp70 proteins and exclusively found in the cytosol of eukaryotic organisms. Hsp110 family members are described as efficient holdases, preventing the aggregation and assisting the refolding of heat-denatured model substrates in the presence of Hsp70 chaperones and their co-chaperones. To gain more insights into the mode of action of this protein family we compared two homologues representing two subtypes of Hsp110 proteins, S. cerevisiae Sse1 and H. sapiens Apg-2, in their structural and functional properties in vitro. In contrast to previous publications both proteins exhibited intrinsic ATPase activities, which only in the case of Sse1 could be stimulated by the Hsp40 co-chaperone Sis1. Similar to Hsp70 proteins ATP binding and hydrolysis induced conformational rearrangements in both Hsp110 proteins as detected by tryptophane fluorescence. However, nucleotide induced changes in the proteolytic digestion pattern were detected only for Sse1. Sse1 and Apg-2 thus show significant differences in their biochemical properties, which may relate to differences in their functional roles in vivo."
Identification of methylated genes and miRNA signatures in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by bioinformatics analysis,29393436,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29393436,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is prevalent in several regions, including. Southern China and Southeast Asia, with high mortality. The present study aimed to explore the epigenetic mechanisms of NPC and to provide novel biomarkers for prognosis. Two methylation data sets (GSE52068 and GSE62336) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Following pretreatment of the raw data, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially methylated CpG islands (DMCs) were identified between the NPC samples and normal tissue controls using COHCAP software. The overlapped DMRs and DMCs in the two data sets were extracted and associated to relevant genes. Enrichment analysis and protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were performed on the identified genes using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integration Discovery and Cytoscape, respectively. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) targeting the overlapped genes were identified based on the miRWalk database. NPC‑related genes were analyzed with the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. Multiple overlapping DMRs between the two data sets were identified and were associated with 1,854 hypermethylated and 18 hypomethylated genes, which were revealed to be enriched in certain pathways, including the mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway. Several nodes in the predicted PPI network were highlighted, including proto‑oncogene tyrosine‑protein kinase SRC, SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3), tyrosine 3‑monooxygenase/tryptophan 5‑monooxygenase activation protein ζ (YWHAZ) and Heat shock protein family A member 4 (HSPA4), all of which were hypomethylated. A total of 14 miRNAs were identified that correlated with the overlapped genes such as miRNA (miR)‑148a‑3p, which was predicted to target of HSPA4; and 17 genes were identified as related to NPC, including SMAD3 and SRC. miR129‑2 was hypermethylated. Several novel methylated genes or miRNAs were suggested as biomarkers for NPC prognosis: Hypomethylation of SRC, SMAD3, YWHAZ and HSPA4, and hypermethylation of miR129‑2 may be linked to poor prognosis of NPC."
The human allicin-proteome: S-thioallylation of proteins by the garlic defence substance allicin and its biological effects,30500420,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30500420,"A single clove of edible garlic (Allium sativum L.) of about 10 g produces up to 5 mg of allicin (diallylthiosulfinate), a thiol-reactive sulfur-containing defence substance that gives injured garlic tissue its characteristic smell. Allicin induces apoptosis or necrosis in a dose-dependent manner but biocompatible doses influence cellular metabolism and signalling cascades. Oxidation of protein thiols and depletion of the glutathione pool are thought to be responsible for allicin's physiological effects. Here, we studied the effect of allicin on post-translational thiol-modification in human Jurkat T-cells using shotgun LC-MS/MS analyses. We identified 332 proteins that were modified by S-thioallylation in the Jurkat cell proteome which causes a mass shift of 72 Da on cysteines. Many S-thioallylated proteins are highly abundant proteins, including cytoskeletal proteins tubulin, actin, cofilin, filamin and plastin-2, the heat shock chaperones HSP90 and HSPA4, the glycolytic enzymes GAPDH, ALDOA, PKM as well the protein translation factor EEF2. Allicin disrupted the actin cytoskeleton in murine L929 fibroblasts. Allicin stimulated the immune response by causing Zn

 release from proteins and increasing the Zn
2+
-dependent IL-1-triggered production of IL-2 in murine EL-4 T-cells. Furthermore, allicin caused inhibition of enolase activity, an enzyme considered a cancer therapy target. In conclusion, our study revealed the widespread extent of S-thioallylation in the human Jurkat cell proteome and showed effects of allicin exposure on essential cellular functions of selected targets, many of which are targets for cancer therapy."

Principal component analysis resolved samples from distinct time points after selection of key discriminatory proteins: 25 proteins were differentially expressed between baseline and 6 months post-surgery; 39 proteins between baseline and 12 months. Eight proteins (SHBG, TF, PRG4, APOA4, LRG1, HSPA4, EPHX2 and PGLYRP) were significantly different to baseline at both 6 and 12 months post-surgery. The panel of proteins identified as consistently different included peptides related to insulin sensitivity (SHBG increase), systemic inflammation (TF and HSPA4-both decreased) and lipid metabolism (APOA4 decreased). We found significant changes in the proteome for eight proteins at 6- and 12-months post-BS, and several of these are key components in metabolic and inflammatory pathways.

Hsp110 protects heat-denatured proteins and confers cellular thermoresistance,9395504,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9395504,"The 110-kDa heat shock protein (hsp110) has long been recognized as one of the primary heat shock proteins in mammalian cells. It belongs to a recently described protein family that is a significantly diverged subgroup of the hsp70 family and has been found in organisms as diverse as yeast and mammals. We describe here the first analysis of the ability of hsp110 to protect cellular and molecular targets from heat damage. It was observed that the overexpression in vivo of hsp110 conferred substantial heat resistance to both Rat-1 and HeLa cells. In vitro heat denaturation and refolding assays demonstrate that hsp110 is highly efficient in selectively recognizing denatured proteins and maintaining them in a soluble, folding-competent state and is significantly more efficient in performing this function than is hsc70. hsp110-bound proteins can then be refolded by the addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate or hsc70 and Hdj-1, whereas Hdj-1 does not itself function as a co-chaperone in folding with hsp110. hsp110 is one of the principal molecular chaperones of mammalian cells and represents a newly identified component of the primary protection/repair pathway for denatured proteins and thermotolerance expression in vivo."

      We identified a total of 70 rare and severe somatic mutations. We found BRAF V600E on all four patients, supporting previous discovery. HSAP4 was also hit by two missense mutations on two different patients. By applying Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis on expression data of odontoblast, ameloblast, and Ameloblastoma, we found a proliferation-associated gene module that was significantly disrupted in tumor tissues. Each patient carried at least two rare, severe somatic mutations affecting genes within this module, including HSPA4, GNAS, CLTC, NES, and KMT2D. All these mutations had a ratio of variant-support reads lower than BRAF V600E, indicating that they occurred later than BRAF V600E.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      We suggest that a severe somatic mutation on the gene network of cell proliferation other than BRAF V600E, namely second hit, may contribute to the tumorigenesis of Ameloblastoma."
Optimized postconditioning algorithm protects liver graft after liver transplantation in rats,29428101,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29428101,"Background:
        

      
      Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) causes postoperative complications and influences the outcome of the patients undergoing liver surgery and transplantation. Postconditioning (PostC) is a known manual conditioning to decrease the hepatic IRI. Here we aimed to optimize the applicable PostC protocols and investigate the potential protective mechanism.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: the sham group (n = 5), standard orthotopic liver transplantation group (OLT, n = 5), PostC group (OLT followed by clamping and re-opening the portal vein for different time intervals, n = 20). PostC group was then subdivided into 4 groups according to the different time intervals: (10 s × 3, 10 s × 6, 30 s × 3, 60 s × 3, n = 5 in each subgroup). Liver function, histopathology, malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), expressions of p-Akt and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) related genes were evaluated.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Compared to the OLT group, the grafts subjected to PostC algorithm (without significant prolonging the total ischemic time) especially with short stimulus and more cycles (10 s × 6) showed significant alleviation of morphological damage and graft function. Besides, the production of reactive oxidative agents (MDA) and neutrophil infiltration (MPO) were significantly depressed by PostC algorithm. Most of ERS related genes were down-regulated by PostC (10 s × 6), especially ATF4, Casp12, hspa4, ATF6 and ELF2, while p-Akt was up-regulated.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      PostC algorithm, especially 10 s × 6 algorithm, showed to be effective against rat liver graft IRI. These protective effects may be associated with its antioxidant, inhibition of ERS and activation of p-Akt expression of reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway."
An immunogenic cell death-related regulators classification patterns and immune microenvironment infiltration characterization in intracranial aneurysm based on machine learning,36248807,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36248807,"Background:
        

      
      Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD) is a novel way to regulate cell death and can sufficiently activate adaptive immune responses. Its role in immunity is still emerging. However, the involvement of ICD in Intracranial Aneurysms (IA) remains unclear. This study aimed to identify biomarkers associated with ICDs and determine the relationship between them and the immune microenvironment during the onset and progression of IA.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      The IA gene expression profiles were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IA were identified and the effects of the ICD on immune microenvironment signatures were studied. Techniques like Lasso, Bayes, DT, FDA, GBM, NNET, RG, SVM, LR, and multivariate analysis were used to identify the ICD gene signatures in IA. A consensus clustering algorithm was used for conducting the unsupervised cluster analysis of the ICD patterns in IA. Furthermore, enrichment analysis was carried out for investigating the various immune responses and other functional pathways. Along with functional annotation, the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module construction, identification of the hub gene, and co-expression analysis were also carried out.
    





          Results:
        

      
      The above techniques were used for establishing the ICD gene signatures of HMGB1, HMGN1, IL33, BCL2, HSPA4, PANX1, TLR9, CLEC7A, and NLRP3 that could easily distinguish IA from normal samples. The unsupervised cluster analysis helped in identifying three ICD gene patterns in different datasets. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that the IA samples showed many differences in pathways such as the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, chemokine signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, viral protein interaction with the cytokines and cytokine receptors, and a few other signaling pathways compared to normal samples. In addition, the three ICD modification modes showed obvious differences in their immune microenvironment and the biological function pathways. Eight ICD-regulators were identified and showed meaningful associations with IA, suggesting they could severe as potential prognostic biomarkers.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      A new gene signature for IA based on ICD features was created. This signature shows that the ICD pattern and the immune microenvironment are closely related to IA and provide a basis for optimizing risk monitoring, clinical decision-making, and developing novel treatment strategies for patients with IA."
Dynamically changed HSP70 after reperfusion following cerebral infarction in human and rats: correlation with p38 MAPK,38597327,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38597327,"We aimed to clarify the correlation between dynamic change of blood HSP70 and the prognosis of thrombolysis in human and rats, so as to explain the neuroprotection and early warning role of HSP70 in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Forty-two patients with acute ischemic stroke were divided into two groups according to the time from onset to thrombolytic therapy: 0 h-3 h (27 patients) and 3-4.5 h group (15 patients). The level of HSP70 in serum before and after thrombolysis was detected by ELISA. Furthermore, a rat model was also used to mimic the ischemic stroke and reperfusion. Peripheral blood of rat samples was collected to detect the level of HSP70 using Elisa. Several signal proteins from MAPK signaling pathway including JNK, p38, ERK (p42/44) were detected at different time points by Western blot of brain tissue. Patients who underwent thrombolytic therapy within 0-3 h had the highest HSP70 level at 1 h after thrombolysis. The higher HSP70 after thrombolysis, the better the patient prognosis. NIHSS scores showed HSP70 was positively correlated with cerebral ischemia. The levels of ERK family (p42/44 MAPK) and p-JNK were decreased gradually along with the time suffering cerebral ischemia. P-ERK, JNK, p-p38 had dynamic changes with increased ischemic time in the middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Dynamic change of HSP70 level in blood may be a biological index that reflects the functional condition of cell survival for cerebral ischemia and estimating the prognostic conditions. Importantly, HSP70 levels in blood were positively correlated with the p38 MAPK pathway in brain tissue."
Analysis and Differential Expression of Primo Genes Using RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR Experiments,31893436,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31893436,"Although the existence of the primo vasculature system has been shown in many species, including mice, rats, rabbits and humans, the biological role of this system, including expression of genes and proteins, has not yet been investigated. Especially the transcriptional action by mRNA, which is required for biological action, needs to be studied in primo vasculature biology. Differentially expressed genes in both isolated primo vessels and lymphatic vessels of rabbits were analyzed by RNA sequencing experiments. Primer efficiency and RNA purity of the primo vessels under lipopolysaccharides were confirmed prior to performing real-time qRT-PCR analysis following RNA extraction. We demonstrated that FLT4 was enriched in primo vessels and that several genes, including HSPH1 and EPHB2, were highly expressed in primo vessels compared with lymphatic vessels. Our data show that almost all genes, except HSPA4, were increased or sustained in isolated primo vessels compared with lymphatic vessels (FLT4 2.58 fold, HSPH1 1.83 fold, EPHB2 1.52 fold; whereas HSPA4 decreased 0.50 fold), suggesting primo vessels as a central regulator in diverse physiology. This implies that FLT4, HSPH1, and EPHB2 in high amounts may be involved in the functional activity of primo vessels. Our experimental data show that several genes are highly enriched in primo vessels in the lymphatic vessels of the rabbit."
Neuroprotective effects of selegiline on rat neural stem cells treated with hydrogen peroxide,29399337,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29399337,"Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species generation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of selegiline against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in hippocampus-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) were evaluated. NSCs isolated from neonatal Wistar rats were pretreated with different doses of selegiline for 48 h and then exposed to 125 µM H2O2 for 30 min. Using MTT and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the effects of selegiline on cell survival, apoptosis and the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and heat shock protein 4 (Hspa4) in pretreated stem cells were assessed compared with a control group lacking pretreatment. The results indicated that the viability of cells pretreated with 20 µM selegiline was significantly increased compared with the control group (P<0.05). Additionally, 20 µM selegiline increased the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and Hspa4 (P<0.05 vs. control) and suppressed oxidative stress-induced cell death (apoptosis and necrosis; P<0.05 vs. control and 10 µM groups). From these findings, it was concluded that selegiline may be a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of neurological diseases mediated by oxidative stress."
Smell Detection Agent Optimisation Framework and Systems Biology Approach to Detect Dys-Regulated Subnetwork in Cancer Data,35053185,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35053185,"Network biology has become a key tool in unravelling the mechanisms of complex diseases. Detecting dys-regulated subnetworks from molecular networks is a task that needs efficient computational methods. In this work, we constructed an integrated network using gene interaction data as well as protein-protein interaction data of differentially expressed genes derived from the microarray gene expression data. We considered the level of differential expression as well as the topological weight of proteins in interaction network to quantify dys-regulation. Then, a nature-inspired Smell Detection Agent (SDA) optimisation algorithm is designed with multiple agents traversing through various paths in the network. Finally, the algorithm provides a maximum weighted module as the optimum dys-regulated subnetwork. The analysis is performed for samples of triple-negative breast cancer as well as colorectal cancer. Biological significance analysis of module genes is also done to validate the results. The breast cancer subnetwork is found to contain (i) valid biomarkers including

Study on Synergistic Antioxidant Effect of Typical Functional Components of Hydroethanolic Leaf Extract from Ginkgo Biloba In Vitro,35056751,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35056751,"The predicted anti-oxidation is related to apoptosis, proliferation, lipid metabolism, cell differentiation, and immune response. There are some differences in the antioxidant capacity of the four typical components of ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) including ginkgo flavone (GF), ginkgolide (G), procyanidins (OPC), and organic acids (OA), and any two members of them can exhibit apparent synergistic effects. The order of DPPH scavenging ability was: OPC > GF > OA > G. The scavenging ability of procyanidins was close to that of VC; the scavenging capacity of ABTS was GF > OPC > OA > G. The GF:OPC (1:9) showed the best synergism in scavenging DPPH and ABTS radicals. The 193 kinds of small molecules reported in EGb were obtained by analyzing the properties of EGb. In order to construct a corresponding biological activity target set, molecular docking and the network pharmacology method were employed to build the molecular action mechanism network of a compound target, and the main biological functions and signaling pathways involved with their antioxidant activities were predicted. The results displayed that the top ten compounds which belonged to the two broad categories, ginkgo flavonoids and proanthocyanidins, could interact closely with several important target proteins (CASP3, SOD2, MAPK1, HSPA4, and NQO1). This would be expected to lay a theoretical foundation for the deep development of Ginkgo biloba extract."
Identification of Immune Hub Genes Associated With Braak Stages in Alzheimer's Disease and Their Correlation of Immune Infiltration,35619939,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35619939,"Background:
        

      
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease. Tau pathology is one of the pathological features of AD, and its progression is closely related to the progress of AD. Immune system dysfunction is an important mediator of Tau pathological progression, but the specific molecular mechanism is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the immune hub genes and peripheral immune cell infiltration associated with the Braak stages, and the molecular mechanisms between them.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      In this study, 60 samples with different Braak stages in the GSE106241 dataset were used to screen Braak stages-related immune hub genes by using the WGCNA package in R and cytoHubba plugin. The temporal lobe expression data in the Alzdata database were used to verify the results. The correlation between the expression level of immune core genes and the pathological features of AD was analyzed to evaluate the abundance of peripheral immune cell infiltration and screened Braak stages-related cells. Finally, we used correlation analysis of immune hub genes and immune cells and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of them.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Seven genes (GRB2, HSP90AA1, HSPA4, IGF1, KRAS, PIK3R1, and PTPN11) were identified as immune core genes after the screening of the test datasets and validation of independent data. Among them, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase Regulatory Subunit 1 (PIK3R1) were the most closely related to Tau and Aβ pathology in AD. In addition, the ImmuneScore increased gradually with the increase of Braak stages. Five types of immune cells (plasma cells, T follicular helper cells, M2 macrophage, activated NK cells, and eosinophils) were correlated with Braak stages. KRAS and PIK3R1 were the immune core genes most related to the abnormal infiltration of peripheral immune cells. They participated in the regulation of the pathological process of AD through axon guidance, long-term potentiation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, RNA polymerase, etc.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      The KRAS and PIK3R1 genes were identified as the immune hub genes most associated with Tau pathological progress in AD. The abnormal infiltration of peripheral immune cells mediated by these cells was involved in the Tau pathological process. This provides new insights for AD."
Establishment of a Prognostic Model for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Based on Bioinformatics and the Role of NR6A1 in the Progression of HCC,36304495,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36304495,"Background and aims:
        

      
      Generally acceptable prognostic models for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not available. This study aimed to establish a prognostic model for HCC by identifying immune-related differentially expressed genes (IR-DEGs) and to investigate the potential role of 
NR6A1
 in the progression of HCC.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Bioinformatics analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas and ImmPort databases was used to identify IR-DEGs. Lasso Cox regression and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to establish a prognostic model of HCC. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the performance of the prognostic model, which was further verified in the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to explore the potential pathways of 
NR6A1
. Cell counting kit 8, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell migration assays using Huh7 cells, and tumor formation models in nude mice were conducted.

NR6A1
 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC patients, and 
NR6A1
 was significantly associated with a low survival rate. Gene set enrichment analysis showed the enrichment of cell cycle, mTOR, WNT, and ERBB signaling pathways in patients with high 
NR6A1
 expression. 
NR6A1

          Conclusions:
        

      
      An effective prognostic model for HCC, based on a novel signature of 10 immune-related genes, was established. 
NR6A1
 was up-regulated in HCC and was associated with a poor prognosis of HCC. 
NR6A1

Identification of proteomic markers for prediction of the response to 5-Fluorouracil based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer patients,35292026,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35292026,"Background:
        

      
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) prior to surgery is the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), while parts of them show poor therapeutic response accompanied by therapy adverse effects. Predictive biomarkers for nCRT response could facilitate the guidance on treatment decisions but are still insufficient until now, which limits the clinical applications of nCRT in LARC patients.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      In our study, 37 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies were obtained from patients with LARC before receiving 5-fluorouracil based nCRT. Proteomics analyses were conducted to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between total responders (TR) and poor responders (PR). The DEPs were validated via ROC plotter web tool and their predictive performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Functional enrichment analyses were performed to further explore the potential mechanisms underlying nCRT response.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Among 3,998 total proteins, 91 DEPs between TR and PR were screened out. HSPA4, NIPSNAP1, and SPTB all with areas under the curve (AUC) ~ 0.8 in the internal discovery cohort were independently validated by the external mRNA datasets (AUC ~ 0.7), and their protein levels were linearly correlated with the graded responses to nCRT in the internal cohort. The combination of HSPA4 and SPTB could distinctly discriminate the TR and PR groups (AUC = 0.980, p < 0.0001). Moreover, multiple combinations of the three proteins realized increased specificity and/or sensitivity, while achieving favorable predictive value when moderate responders were introduced into the ROC analysis. Pathways including DNA damage repair, cell cycle, and epithelial mesenchymal transition were involved in nCRT response according to the enrichment analysis results.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      HSPA4, SPTB and NIPSNAP1 in tumor biopsies and/or their optional combinations might be potential predictive markers for nCRT response in patients with LARC. The DEPs and their related functions have implications for the potential mechanisms of treatment response to nCRT in patients with LARC."
Proliferation of dental follicle-derived cell populations in heat-stress conditions,21951291,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21951291,"Objectives:
        

      
      Isolation and purification of adult stem cells (ASC) are a great challenge. Our objectives were to determine whether ASC are more heat-tolerant than non-stem cells, and to explore if ASC could be enriched by heat-stress treatments.
    





          Materials and methods:
        

      
      Rat dental follicle cells were cultured in a variety of media to obtain either a heterogeneous cell population (H-DFC) consisting of stem cells and non-stem cells, or a homogenous cell population (DFC) containing non-stem cells only. Real-time RT-PCR was conducted to compare expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) between the two populations. To study heat tolerance, H-DFC and DFC were incubated under heat-stress conditions and cell proliferation was evaluated by alamar blue reduction assay. Furthermore, cells resulting from heat-stress treatments were evaluated for differentiation capability and expression of stem cell markers.
    





          Results:
        

      
      H-DFC expressed higher levels of HSP110, HSP70s and HSP27s than did DFC. H-DFC increased levels of proliferation at 40 °C compared to controls grown at 37 °C; no significant reduction in proliferation occurred at temperatures below 40.5 °C. In contrast, DFC showed significant reduction in proliferation under all heat-stress treatments. Heat-stressed H-DFC had increased differentiation capability and increased expression of stem cell markers.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      Stem cells appear to be more tolerant to heat stress than non-stem cells. Incubation of a heterogeneous cell population in heat-stress conditions resulted in increased stem cell numbers."
Genome-wide scan reveals divergent selection among taurine and zebu cattle populations from different regions,30246258,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30246258,"In this study, to identify genomic signatures of divergent selection, we genotyped 10 cattle breeds/populations (n = 275), representing eight Ethiopian cattle populations (n = 229) and two zebu populations (n = 46) adapted to tropical and sub-tropical environments, using the high-density single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived mainly from Bos indicus breeds, and using five reference taurine breeds (n = 212). Population genetic differentiation (F
ST
 ) values across sliding windows were estimated between zebu and reference combined taurine breeds. The most differentiated regions (F
ST
 ≥ 0.53), representing the top 1% smoothed F
ST
 values, were considered to represent regions under diversifying selection. In total, 285 and 317 genes were identified in the comparisons of Ethiopian cattle with taurine and Asian zebu with taurine respectively. Some of these genes are involved in stress responses/thermo-tolerance and DNA damage repair (HSPA4, HSF1, CMPK1 and EIF2AK4), pigmentation (ERBB3 and MYO1A), reproduction/fertility (UBE2D3, ID3 and PSPC1), immune response (PIK3CD and AKIRIN2) and body stature and size (MBP2, LYN and NPM1). Additionally, the candidate genes were associated with functional terms (e.g. cellular response to stress, DNA repair, inflammatory response) important for physiological adaptation to environmental stresses. The results of our study may shed light on the influence of artificial and natural selection in shaping the genomic diversity of modern cattle breeds and also may serve as a basis for further genetic investigation of traits of tropical adaptation in cattle."
Identification of thioredoxin-1 as a biomarker of lung cancer and evaluation of its prognostic value based on bioinformatics analysis,36776308,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36776308,"Background:
        

      
      Thioredoxin-1 (TXN), a redox balance factor, plays an essential role in oxidative stress and has been shown to act as a potential contributor to various cancers. This study evaluated the role of TXN in lung cancer by bioinformatics analyses.
    





          Materials and methods:
        

      
      Genes differentially expressed in lung cancer and oxidative stress related genes were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus and GeneCards databases. Following identification of TXN as an optimal differentially expressed gene by bioinformatics, the prognostic value of TXN in lung cancer was evaluated by univariate/multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, with validation by receiver operation characteristic curve analysis. The association between TXN expression and lung cancer was verified by immunohistochemical analysis of the Human Protein Atlas database, as well as by western blotting and qPCR. Cell proliferation was determined by cell counting kit-8 after changing TXN expression using lentiviral transfection.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Twenty differentially expressed oxidative stress genes were identified. Differential expression analysis identified five genes (
CASP3, CAT, TXN, GSR
, and 
HSPA4
) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis identified four genes (
IL-6, CYCS, TXN
, and 
BCL2
) that differed significantly in lung cancer and normal lung tissue, indicating that TXN was an optimal differentially expressed gene. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that T stage (T3/T4), N stage (N2/N3), curative effect (progressive diseases) and high TXN expression were associated with poor survival, although high TXN expression was poorly predictive of overall survival. TXN was highly expressed in lung cancer tissues and cells. Knockdown of TXN suppressed cell proliferation, while overexpression of TXN enhanced cell proliferation.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      High expression of TXN plays an important role in lung cancer development and prognosis. Because it is a prospective prognostic factor, targeting TXN may have clinical benefits in the treatment of lung cancer."
Gene expression profile analysis of ENO1 knockdown in gastric cancer cell line MGC-803,30930989,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30930989,"Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-associated mortality. In a previous study, we identified that α-enolase (ENO1) promoted cell migration in GC, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, small interfering RNAs were identified to interfere with ENO1 expression. The cDNA expression profiling was performed using an Affymetrix mRNA array platform to identify genes that may be associated with ENO1 in human GC cell line MGC-803. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, followed by a series of bioinformatic analyses. As a result, there were 448 DEGs, among which 183 (40.85%) were downregulated. The most significant functional terms for the DEGs were the nuclear lumen for cell components (P=2.83×10
-4
), transcription for biological processes (P=3.7×10
-7
) and transcription factor activity for molecular functions (P=1.16×10
4
). In total, six significant pathways were enriched, including the most common cancer-associated forkhead box O signaling pathway (P=0.0077), microRNAs in cancer (P=0.0183) and the cAMP signaling pathway (P=0.0415). Furthermore, a network analysis identified three hub genes (HUWE1, PPP1CB and HSPA4), which were all involved in tumor metastasis. Taken together, the DEGs, significant pathways and hub genes identified in the present study shed some light on the molecular mechanisms of ENO1 involved in the pathogenesis of GC."
Identification and Validation of Stage-Associated PBMC Biomarkers in Breast Cancer Using MS-Based Proteomics,32793473,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32793473,"Background:
 It is well-described that the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can be altered in the context of many malignancies to allow them avoid the effective immune response, which leads to cancer invasiveness. Here, we used an MS-based strategy to discover biomarkers in the PBMCs of breast cancer (BC) patients and validated them at different stages of BC. 
Methods:
 PBMCs were isolated from the breast cancer patients and were cultured alone or co-cultured with breast cancer cell lines. The role of PBMC in the invasion property of breast cancer cells was explored. NF-kB activity was also measured in the co-cultured breast cancer cells. Identification of protein profiles in the secretome and proteome of the co-cultured PBMCs was performed using SWATH mass spectrometry. Pathway enrichment and gene ontology analyses were carried out to look for the molecular pathways correlated with the protein expression profile of PBMCs in the breast cancer patients. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to validate the candidate genes in the PBMC fraction of the breast cancer patients at the primary and metastatic stages. 
In silico
 survival analysis was performed to assess the potential clinical biomarkers in these PBMC subtypes. 
Results:
 PBMCs could significantly increase the invasion property of the BC cells concomitant with a decrease in E-cadherin and an increase in both Vimentin and N-cadherin expression. The NF-kB activity in the BC cells significantly increased following co-culturing implying the role of PBMCs in EMT induction. Enrichment analysis showed that the differentially expressed proteins in PBMCs are mainly associated with IL-17, PI3K-Akt, and HIF-1 signaling pathway, in which a set of seven proteins including TMSB4X, HSPA4, S100A9, SRSF6, THBS1, CUL4A, and CANX were frequently expressed. Finally, 
in silico
 analysis confirmed that a gene set consisting of S100A9, SRSF6, THBS1, CUL4A, and CANX were found to provide an insight for the identification of metastasis in breast cancer patients. 
Conclusion:
 In conclusion, our study revealed that the protein expression profile in PBMCs is a reflection of the proteins expressed in the BC tissue itself; however, the abundance level is different due to the stage of cancer."
Immune profiles of male giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) during the breeding season,33639852,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33639852,"Background:
        

      
      The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a threatened endemic Chinese species and a flagship species of national and global conservation concern. Life history theory proposes that reproduction and immunity can be mutually constraining and interrelated. Knowledge of immunity changes of male giant pandas during the breeding season is limited.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Here, we researched peripheral blood gene expression profiles associated with immunity. Thirteen captive giant pandas, ranging from 9 to 11 years old, were divided into two groups based on their reproductive status. We identified 318 up-regulated DEGs and 43 down-regulated DEGs, which were enriched in 87 GO terms and 6 KEGG pathways. Additionally, we obtained 45 immune-related genes with altered expression, mostly up-regulated, and identified four hub genes HSPA4, SUGT1, SOD1, and IL1B in PPI analysis. These 45 genes were related to pattern recognition receptors, autophagy, peroxisome, proteasome, natural killer cell, antigen processing and presentation. SUGT1 and IL1B were related to pattern recognition receptors. HSP90AA1 was the most up-regulated gene and is a member of heat shock protein 90 family. HSP90 contributes to the translocation of extracellular antigen. KLRD1 encodes CD94, whose complex is an inhibitor of the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, was down-regulated. IGIP, which has the capability of inducing IgA production by B cells, was down-regulated, suggesting low concentration of IgA in male giant pandas. Our results suggest that most immune-related genes were up-regulated and more related to innate immune than adaptive immune.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Our results indicated that breeding male giant pandas presented an immunoenhancement in innate immunity, enhanced antigen presentation and processing in cellular immunity compared to non-breeding males. The humoral immunity of male giant pandas may show a tendency to decrease during the breeding season. This study will provide a foundation for further studies of immunity and reproduction in male giant pandas."
A Comprehensive Stemness Gene Expression Analysis Signifies the Role of ABC Transporters and Molecular Chaperons in Determining the Fate of Human Neural Precursor Cells,35864646,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35864646,"Background and aim:
        

      
      The major aim of this study was to identify the most common stemness genes across different stem cell types and further validate them in human fetal subventricular zone-derived primary and cultured neural precursor cells (NPCs). This study involved the use of a unique method of stemness meta-analysis (SMA) for investigating comprehensive upregulation and downregulation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among different stem cell populations.
    





          Materials and methods:
        

      
      A total of 55 mouse and human data sets targeting crucial genes identified in seven different types of stem cells population were screened and subjected to independent DEGs analysis using SMA. Identified 30 meta-gene signatures were subjected to functional enrichment analysis based on their biological processes and molecular functions. Validation of enriched meta-gene signatures was performed using RT-qPCR. Cellular localization of ABCB1 and ABCG2 was identified using immunofluorescence staining, whereas functional assessment was performed using western-blot.
    





          Results:
        

      
      SMA analysis revealed that among 52 commonly expressed genes, 30 genes were either upregulated or downregulated in at least two stem cell populations. Further gene enrichment analysis showed nine genes (ABCB1, ABCG2, HSPA4, HSPA9, HSPA14, Nestin, Sox-2, Oct-4, and Notch-2) with the highest combined scores among 30 meta-gene signatures. RT-qPCR demonstrated that all the enriched gene signatures were significantly upregulated in primary NPCs and further downregulated during NPCs lineage differentiation in culture except HSPA4, HSPA9, and HSPA14 gene transcripts.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      The stemness meta-gene signatures were abundantly expressed in human NPCs population which categorically suggest the involvement of these genes/pathways in pluripotency maintenance and molecular switches for lineage differentiation while HSP-70 had a neuroprotective effect."
"The functional mechanisms of synchronizing royal jelly consumption and physical activity on rat with multiple sclerosis-like behaviors hallmarks based on bioinformatics analysis, and experimental survey",35676653,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35676653,"Background:
        

      
      Natural nutrition and physical training have been defined as non-pharmacochemical complementary and alternative medicines to prevent and treat various pathogenesis. Royal jelly possesses various pharmacological properties and is an effective therapeutic supplement for halting neurodegeneration. Multiple sclerosis is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that manifests as a progressive neurological condition. Inflammation, hypoxia, and oxidative stress have been identified as significant hallmarks of multiple sclerosis pathology.
    





          Results:
        

      
      In the present study, based on artificial intelligence and bioinformatics algorithms, we marked hub genes, molecular signaling pathways, and molecular regulators such as non-coding RNAs involved in multiple sclerosis. Also, microRNAs as regulators can affect gene expression in many processes. Numerous pathomechanisms, including immunodeficiency, hypoxia, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, can play a significant role in the MSc pathogenesis that results in demyelination. Furthermore, we computed the binding affinity of bioactive compounds presented in Royal Jelly on macromolecules surfaces. Also, we predicted the alignment score of bioactive compounds over the pharmacophore model of candidate protein as a novel therapeutic approach. Based on the q-RT-PCR analysis, the expression of the Dnajb1/Dnajb1/Foxp1/Tnfsf14 and Hspa4 networks as well as miR-34a-5p and miR155-3p were regulated by the interaction of exercise training and 100 mg/kg Royal Jelly (ET-100RJ). Interestingly, characteristics, motor function, a proinflammatory cytokine, and demyelination were ameliorated by ET-100RJ.
    





          Discussion:
        

      
      Here, we indicated that interaction between exercise training and 100 mg/kg Royal jelly had a more effect on regulating the microRNA profiles and hub genes in rats with Multiple sclerosis."
Gene cloning of immunogenic antigens overexpressed in pancreatic cancer,11237751,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11237751,"The serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX) by utilizing a library derived from a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line and IgG antibodies from an allogeneic patient serum led to the identification of 18 genes: 13 of these were known genes, and 5 were unknown genes. In Northern and RT-PCR analyses, we found that the expression of mRNA of 14 genes was elevated in pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with the levels in normal pancreatic tissues. In addition, the expression of mRNA of hsp105 in colon cancer was greater than that in normal colon tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-hsp105 antibody revealed that an increased expression of hsp105 is a characteristic feature of pancreatic ductal and colon adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, hsp105 immunoreactivity in some cases of gastric, esophageal, and hepatocellular carcinoma was much stronger than that in normal corresponding tissues. These molecules identified may provide good diagnostic markers for cancer cells."

Influence of Mild Chronic Stress and Social Isolation on Acute Ozone-Induced Alterations in Stress Biomarkers and Brain-Region-Specific Gene Expression in Male Wistar-Kyoto Rats,38001817,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38001817,"Individuals with psychosocial stress often experience an exaggerated response to air pollutants. Ozone (O

Male Wistar-Kyoto rats (5 weeks old) were socially isolated, plus were subjected to either CS (noise, confinement, fear, uncomfortable living, hectic activity, and single housing), SI (single housing only, restricted handling and no enrichment) or no stress (NS; double housing, frequent handling and enrichment provided) for 8 weeks. The rats were then exposed to either air or O

Apg-2 has a chaperone-like activity similar to Hsp110 and is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinomas,14987991,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14987991,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world. We constructed subtracted cDNA libraries enriched with genes overexpressed in HCCs. Among the 17 genes identified were molecular chaperones, Hsp110, Hsp90B, and Hsp70-1. Expression of the Hsp110 family members was further analyzed, and increased transcript levels of Hsp110 and Apg-2, but not Apg-1, were found in 12 and 14, respectively, of 18 HCCs. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the overexpression of the proteins in tumor cells. Apg-2 had chaperone ability similar to Hsp110 in a thermal denaturation assay using luciferase, and showed anti-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that the Hsp110 family members play important roles in hepatocarcinogenesis through their chaperoning activities."
Let-7c miRNA Inhibits the Proliferation and Migration of Heat-Denatured Dermal Fibroblasts Through Down-Regulating HSP70,26923191,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26923191,"Wound healing is a complex physiological process necessitating the coordinated action of various cell types, signals and microRNAs (miRNAs). However, little is known regarding the role of miRNAs in mediating this process. In the present study, we show that let-7c miRNA is decreased in heat-denatured fibroblasts and that inhibiting let-7c expression leads to the increased proliferation and migration of dermal fibroblasts, whereas the overexpression of let-7c exerts an opposite effect. Further investigation has identified heat shock protein 70 as a direct target of let-7c and has demonstrated that the expression of HSP70 in fibroblasts is negatively correlated with let-7c levels. Moreover, down-regulation of let-7c expression is accompanied by up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression and down-regulation of Bax expression, both of which are the downstream genes of HSP70. Notably, the knockdown of HSP70 by HSP70 siRNA apparently abrogates the stimulatory effect of let-7c inhibitor on heat-denatured fibroblasts proliferation and migration. Overall, we have identified let-7c as a key regulator that inhibits fibroblasts proliferation and migration during wound healing."
Bioinformatics enrichment analysis of genes and pathways related to maternal type 1 diabetes associated with adverse fetal outcomes,32046932,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32046932,"Maternal type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) may affect fetal development by altering the gene expression profile of the umbilical cord. The present study aimed to explore the T1DM-induced gene expression changes in the fetal umbilical cord. The raw gene expression profiles (ID: GSE51546) of umbilical cord tissue obtained from six normal mothers (non-diabetic) and six type 1 diabetic mothers were used to identify the differentially expressed genes. Genes that correspond to official gene symbols were selected for protein-protein interaction (PPI) and sub-network construction (combined score > 0.4). Functional annotation for Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis were performed for genes involved in networking. A total of 110 differentially expressed genes were identified of which 38 were up-regulated while 72 were down-regulated. Only 37 genes were identified to significantly interact with each other. Hub genes including HSPA4, KCTD6, UBE2G1, FBXL19, and EHMT1 were up-regulated while KBTBD7, TRIM32, and NUP were down-regulated. T1DM had a major effect on the expression of genes involved in cellular death and differentiation, cell signaling and communication, protein modification and regulation of GTPase activity. Total 27 pathways were enriched and genes related to Wnt signaling, VEGF signaling, inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways, FGF signaling pathways and GnRH receptor pathways were found significantly affected by T1DM. Our results suggest that the T1DM environment seems to alter umbilical cord gene expression involved in the regulation of pathophysiology of the diabetic mother which in turn may lead to long-term consequences in various tissues in infants. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the adverse pregnancy outcomes of maternal T1DM."
"Transient hypoxia leads to increased serum levels of heat shock protein-27, -70 and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18",24660549,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24660549,"Background:
        

      
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide burden. We have previously shown that elevated levels of heat shock protein-27 (HSP27), -70 (HSP70), and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 (ccCK-18) were found in serum of COPD patients correlating with disease severity. We hypothesized that transient hypoxia triggers the release of HSPs and ccCK-18.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Fourteen healthy volunteers were subjected to transient normobaric hypoxia in an air-conditioned hypoxia chamber simulating an oxygen concentration at an altitude of up to 5500 meters. Serum samples were evaluated for HSP27, -70, and ccCK-18.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Baseline concentrations were 2760 pg/mL +/- 517 SEM for HSP-27, 49 pg/mL +/- 22 SEM for HSP-70, and 226 U/L +/- 20 SEM for ccCK-18. After eight hours and an altitude equivalent of 5500 meters a significant increase was recorded, depicted by serum levels of 3737 pg/mL +/- 571 SEM for HSP-27, 202 pg/mL +/- 81 SEM for HSP-70, and 244 U/L +/- 20 SEM for ccCK-18 (p < 0.05).

In this study, 26 individuals of MN and MG were sequenced for the first time at an average of 13.9- and 12.8-fold, respectively. Large numbers of different variations were identified. In addition, the analyses of phylogenetic and population structure showed that these two cattle breeds are distinct from each other, and results of linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that these two cattle breeds have undergone various degrees of intense natural or artificial selection. Subsequently, 496 and 306 potential selected genes (PSRs) were obtained in MN and MG, containing 1,096 and 529 potential selected genes (PSGs), respectively. These PSGs, together with the analyzed copy number variation (CNV)-related genes, showed potential relations with their phenotypic characteristics, including environmental adaptability (e.g.,

"Cellular responses of novel human pancreatic β-cell line, 1.1B4 to hyperglycemia",23985558,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23985558,"The novel human-derived pancreatic β-cell line, 1.1B4 exhibits insulin secretion and β-cell enriched gene expression. Recent investigations of the cellular responses of this novel cell line to lipotoxicity and cytokine toxicity revealed similarities to primary human β cells. The current study has investigated the responses of 1.1B4 cells to chronic 48 and 72 h exposure to hyperglycemia to probe mechanisms of human β-cell dysfunction and cell death. Exposure to 25 mM glucose significantly reduced insulin content (p<0.05) and glucokinase activity (p<0.01) after 72 h. Basal insulin release was unaffected but acute secretory response to 16.7 mM glucose was impaired (p<0.05). Insulin release stimulated by alanine, GLP-1, KCl, elevated Ca (2+) and forskolin was also markedly reduced after exposure to hyperglycemia (p<0.001). In addition, PDX1 protein expression was reduced by 58% by high glucose (p<0.05). Effects of hyperglycemia on secretory function were accompanied by decreased mRNA expression of INS, GCK, PCSK1, PCSK2, PPP3CB, GJA1, ABCC8, and KCNJ11. In contrast, exposure to hyperglycemia upregulated the transcription of GPX1, an antioxidant enzyme involved in detoxification of hydrogen peroxide and HSPA4, a molecular chaperone involved in ER stress response. Hyperglycemia-induced DNA damage was demonstrated by increased % tail DNA and olive tail moment, assessed by comet assay. Hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis was evident from increased activity of caspase 3/7 and decreased BCL2 protein. These observations reveal significant changes in cellular responses and gene expression in novel human pancreatic 1.1B4 β cells exposed to hyperglycemia, illustrating the usefulness of this novel human-derived cell line for studying human β-cell biology and diabetes."
"Toxicity Induced by Cytokines, Glucose, and Lipids Increase Apoptosis and Hamper Insulin Secretion in the 1.1E7 Beta Cell-Line",33806355,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33806355,"Basic research on types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus require early stage studies using beta cells or cell lines, ideally of human origin and with preserved insulin secretion in response to glucose. The 1.1E7 cells are a hybrid cell line resulting from the electrofusion of dispersed human islets and PANC-1 cells, capable of secreting insulin in response to glucose, but their survival and function under toxic conditions remains untested. This characterization is the purpose of the present study. We treated these cells with a cytokine mix, high glucose, palmitate, and the latter two combined. Under these conditions, we measured cell viability and apoptosis (MTT, Caspase Glo and TUNEL assays, as well as caspase-8 and -9 levels by Western blotting), endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (EIF2AK3, HSPA4, EIF2a, and HSPA5) by real-time PCR, and insulin secretion with a glucose challenge. All of these stimuli (i) induce apoptosis and ER stress markers expression, (ii) reduce mRNA amounts of 2-5 components of genes involved in the insulin secretory pathway, and (iii) abrogate the insulin release capability of 1.1E7 cells in response to glucose. The most pronounced effects were observed with cytokines and with palmitate and high glucose combined. This characterization may well serve as the starting point for those choosing this cell line for future basic research on certain aspects of diabetes."
Heat Shock 70 Protein Genes and Genetic Susceptibility to Apical Periodontitis,27567034,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567034,"Introduction:
        

      
      Heat shock proteins (HSPs) protect cells under adverse conditions such as infection, inflammation, and disease. The differential expression of HSPs in human periapical granulomas suggests a potential role for these proteins in periapical lesion development, which may contribute to different clinical outcomes. Therefore, we hypothesized that polymorphisms in HSP genes leading to perturbed gene expression and protein function may contribute to an individual's susceptibility to periapical lesion development.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Subjects with deep carious lesions with or without periapical lesions (≥3 mm) were recruited at the University of Texas School of Dentistry at Houston and at the University of Pittsburgh. Genomic DNA samples of 400 patients were sorted into 2 groups: 183 cases with deep carious lesions and periapical lesions (cases) and 217 cases with deep carious lesions but without periapical lesions (controls). Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HSPA4, HSPA6, HSPA1L, HSPA4L, and HSPA9 genes were selected for genotyping. Genotypes were generated by end point analysis by using Taqman chemistry in a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared among cases and controls by using χ(2) and Fisher exact tests as implemented in PLINK v.1.07. In silico analysis of SNP function was performed by using Polymorphism Phenotyping V2 and MirSNP software.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Overall, SNPs in HSPA1L and HSPA6 showed significant allelic association with cases of deep caries and periapical lesions (P < .05). We also observed altered transmission of HSPA1L SNP haplotypes (P = .03). In silico analysis of HSPA1L rs2075800 function showed that this SNP results in a glutamine-to-lysine substitution at position 602 of the protein and might affect the stability and function of the final protein.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Variations in HSPA1L and HSPA6 may be associated with periapical lesion formation in individuals with untreated deep carious lesions. Future studies could help predict host susceptibility to developing apical periodontitis."

      To investigate the correlation of stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) expression level with prognosis of different cancers and its potential role in immunotherapy.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      TCGA, TARGET and GTEx databases were used for bioinformatic analysis of STIP1 expression level and its prognostic value in different cancers. We also detected STIP1 expression immunohistochemically in 10 pairs of colorectal cancer and adjacent tissues. We further analyzed the correlation of STIP1 expression level with tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, immune cell infiltration, immune regulators and outcomes of different cancers. STIP1- related proteins were identified using protein- protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and functional enrichment analysis was performed to analyze the regulatory pathways involving STIP1.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Bioinformatics analysis showed that STIP1 was highly expressed in most tumors compared with the normal tissues (
P
 < 0.05), which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of the 10 pairs of colorectal cancer tissues. STIP1 expression level was correlated with clinical stages of multiple cancers (
P
 < 0.05), and in some cancer types, an upregulated STIP1 expression was correlated with a poor prognosis of the patients in terms of overall survival, disease-specific survival, disease-free survival and progression-free survival (
P
 < 0.05). STIP1 expression was significantly correlated with tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, immune cell infiltration and immunomodulatory factors in most tumors (
P
 < 0.05). PPI network analysis indicated that STIP1-related proteins included HSPA4, HSPA8, and HSP90AA1. KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that the high expression of STIP1 in liver cancer was related mainly with valerate metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and butyrate metabolism pathways; HALLMARK enrichment analysis suggested high STIP1 expression in liver cancer was involved in bile acid and fatty acid metabolism.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      STIP1 is up-regulated in multiple cancer types and its expression level is correlated with clinical tumor stage, tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, immune cell infiltration and immunomodulatory factors."

The study comprised of 14 nonobstructive azoospermic men (N = 4; normal FSH and normal testicular volume and N = 10; high FSH and small testicular volume) and seven normozoospermic men. Proteomic analysis was done using LC-MS. GSTM3 and PGK2 were less abundant in the normal and high FSH group compared to controls. HSPA4L and HSPA4 were exclusively present in control group whereas HSP90AB1, HSPA1B, HSP90AA1 and HSPA2 were less abundant and exclusive to the normal and high FSH group. We have identified six heat-shock proteins that may have a role in the pathology of NOA. FSH and testicular volume by itself are not good markers of NOA. The inverse association of GSTM3 and PGK2 regulation with FSH levels along with 12 proteins exclusively in NOA groups suggests further evaluation of their predictive potential in a larger cohort of patients."
Insertional mutagenesis by replication-deficient retroviral vectors encoding the large T oncogene,17395733,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17395733,"Insertion sites of replication-deficient retroviral vectors may trigger clonal dominance of hematopoietic cells in vivo. Here, we tested whether this would also be the case when using vectors that express powerful oncogenes, such as the large tumor antigen (TAg) of simian virus 40. TAg inactivates the tumor-suppressor proteins p53 and Rb by virtue of a chaperone-like activity. Primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells transduced with retroviral vectors encoding TAg-induced histiocytic sarcoma (HS) or myeloid leukemia (ML) in transplanted mice (average survival of 21 weeks). Retrovirally introducing TAg into pretransformed 32D cells generated a monocytic leukemia, with faster kinetics ( approximately 8 weeks). Leukemic clones showed retroviral insertions in genes contributing to all known TAg cooperation pathways, acting mitogenic and/or modulating apoptosis (such as BclX, Crk, Pim2, Csfr1/Pdgfrb, Osm/Lif, Axl, Fli, Sema4b, Sox4). 32D-derived monocytic leukemias showed hits in Pim2 and Max proto-oncogenes, or the chaperone Hspa4, plus additional signaling genes. Vector-mediated insertional mutagenesis thus revealed a broad spectrum of potential TAg complementation genes. These findings have important implications for the use of retroviral transgenesis in cancer research, and the expression of signaling genes in somatic gene therapy."
Meta-Analyses of Microarray Datasets Identifies ANO1 and FADD as Prognostic Markers of Head and Neck Cancer,26808319,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26808319,"The head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) transcriptome has been profiled extensively, nevertheless, identifying biomarkers that are clinically relevant and thereby with translational benefit, has been a major challenge. The objective of this study was to use a meta-analysis based approach to catalog candidate biomarkers with high potential for clinical application in HNSCC. Data from publically available microarray series (N = 20) profiled using Agilent (4X44K G4112F) and Affymetrix (HGU133A, U133A_2, U133Plus 2) platforms was downloaded and analyzed in a platform/chip-specific manner (GeneSpring software v12.5, Agilent, USA). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering analysis was carried out iteratively for segregating outliers; 140 normal and 277 tumor samples from 15 series were included in the final analysis. The analyses identified 181 differentially expressed, concordant and statistically significant genes; STRING analysis revealed interactions between 122 of them, with two major gene clusters connected by multiple nodes (MYC, FOS and HSPA4). Validation in the HNSCC-specific database (N = 528) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified a panel (ECT2, ANO1, TP63, FADD, EXT1, NCBP2) that was altered in 30% of the samples. Validation in treatment naïve (Group I; N = 12) and post treatment (Group II; N = 12) patients identified 8 genes significantly associated with the disease (Area under curve>0.6). Correlation with recurrence/re-recurrence showed ANO1 had highest efficacy (sensitivity: 0.8, specificity: 0.6) to predict failure in Group I. UBE2V2, PLAC8, FADD and TTK showed high sensitivity (1.00) in Group I while UBE2V2 and CRYM were highly sensitive (>0.8) in predicting re-recurrence in Group II. Further, TCGA analysis showed that ANO1 and FADD, located at 11q13, were co-expressed at transcript level and significantly associated with overall and disease-free survival (p<0.05). The meta-analysis approach adopted in this study has identified candidate markers correlated with disease outcome in HNSCC; further validation in a larger cohort of patients will establish their clinical relevance."
Identification of mRNA and non-coding RNA hubs using network analysis in organ tropism regulated triple negative breast cancer metastasis,33126129,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33126129,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is aggressive in nature, resistant to conventional therapy and often ends in organ specific metastasis. In this study, publicly available datasets were used to identify miRNA, mRNA and lncRNA hubs. Using validated mRNA-miRNA, mRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-miRNA interaction information obtained from various databases, RNA interaction networks for TNBC and its subtype specific as well as organ tropism regulated metastasis were generated. Further, miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA triad classification was performed using social network analysis from subnetworks and visualized using Cytoscape. Survival analysis of the RNA hubs, oncoprint analysis for mRNAs and pathway analysis of the lncRNAs were also performed. Results indicated that two lncRNAs (NEAT1 and CASC7) and four miRNAs (hsa-miR-106b-5p, hsa-miR-148a-3p, hsa-miR-25-3p and hsa-let-7i-5p) were common between hubs identified in TNBC and TNBC associated metastasis. The exclusive hubs for TNBC associated metastasis were hsa-miR-200b-3p, SP1, HSPA4 and RAB1B. HMGA1 was the top ranked hub in mesenchymal subtype associated lung metastasis, while hsa-miR-27a-3p was identified as the top ranked hub mRNA in luminal androgen receptor subtype associated bone metastasis. When lncRNA associated pathway analysis was performed, Hs Cytoplasmic Ribosomal Protein pathway was found to be the most significant and among the selected hubs, CTNND1, SON and hsa-miR-29c emerged as TNBC survival markers. TP53, FOXA1, MTDH and HDGF were found as the top ranked mRNAs in oncoprint analysis. The pipeline proposed for the first time in this study with validated RNA interaction data integration and graph-based learning for miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA triad classification from RNA hubs may aid experimental cost reduction and its successful execution will allow it to be extended to other diseases too."
Proteomic-based identification of Apg-2 as a therapeutic target for chronic myeloid leukemia,24012954,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24012954,"The oncogenic BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase induces constitutive enhanced ""spontaneous"" DNA damage and unfaithful repair in Philadelphia chromosome positive leukemia cells. Here, we investigated the changes of protein profile in H2O2-induced DNA damage/repair in BaF3-MIGR1 and BaF3-BCR/ABL cells through a proteomic strategy consisting of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In total, 41 spots were differentially expressed and 13 proteins were identified with further MS analysis. Two essential proteins, Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 (c-ABL) and Heat shock 70kDa protein 4 (Apg-2), were confirmed by Western blot and showed consistent changes with proteomic results. Moreover, functional analysis demonstrated that inhibition of Apg-2 not only decreased cell proliferation, but also induced cell apoptosis in BCR/ABL positive cells (BaF3-BCR/ABL, BaF3-BCR/ABL(T315I)). We also proved that Apg-2 inhibition aggravated H2O2 induced damage in BCR/ABL positive cells, and enhanced the sensitivity of BaF3-BCR/ABL(T315I) to STI571. Taken together, the findings in this work provide us with some clues to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BCR/ABL in the DNA damage/repair processes and demonstrated that Apg-2 would be a valid target for anti-leukemia drug development."
Analysis of the transcriptome data in Litopenaeus vannamei reveals the immune basis and predicts the hub regulation-genes in response to high-pH stress,30517152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30517152,"Soil salinization erodes the farmlands and poses a serious threat to human life, reuse of the saline-alkali lands as cultivated resources becomes increasingly prominent. Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) is an important farmed aquatic species for the development and utilization of the saline-alkali areas. However, little is known about the adaptation mechanism of this species in terms of high-pH stress. In the present study, a transcriptome analysis on the gill tissues of L. vannamei in response to high-pH stress (pH 9.3 ± 0.1) was conducted. After analyzing, the cyclic nucleotide gated channel-Ca2+ (CNGC-Ca2+) and patched 1 (Ptc1) were detected as the majority annotated components in the cAMP signaling pathway (KO04024), indicating that the CNGC-Ca2+ and Ptc1 might be the candidate components for transducing and maintaining the high-pH stress signals, respectively. The immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), heat shock protein (HSP), glutathione s-transferase (GST), prophenoloxidase/phenoloxidase (proPO/PO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) and lipoprotein were discovered as the major transcribed immune factors in response to high-pH stress. To further detect hub regulation-genes, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed; the genes/proteins ""Polymerase (RNA) II (DNA directed) polypeptide A"" (POLR2A), ""Histone acetyltransferase p300"" (EP300) and ""Heat shock 70kDa protein 8"" (HSPA8) were suggested as the top three hub regulation-genes in response to acute high-pH stress; the genes/proteins ""Heat shock 70kDa protein 4"" (HSPA4), ""FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog"" (FOS) and ""Nucleoporin 54kDa"" (NUP54) were proposed as the top three hub regulation-genes involved in adapting endurance high-pH stress; the protein-interactions of ""EP300-HSPA8"" and ""HSPA4-NUP54"" were detected as the most important biological interactions in response to the high-pH stress; and the HSP70 family genes might play essential roles in the adaptation of the high-pH stress environment in L. vannamei. These findings provide the first insight into the molecular and immune basis of L. vannamei in terms of high-pH environments, and the construction of a PPI network might improve our understanding in revealing the hub regulation-genes in response to abiotic stress in shrimp species and might be beneficial for further studies."
Identification of GRASP-1 as a novel 97 kDa autoantigen localized to endosomes,15897011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15897011,"We have identified an autoantigen that is recognized by antibodies from an 18-year-old female with a history of recurrent infections who later in her clinical course developed Raynaud's phenomenon and telangiectasias. By indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), the index serum produced a unique cytoplasmic discrete speckled (CDS) staining pattern that partially colocalized with early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) but not Golgi complex or other cytoplasmic organelles in HEp-2 cells. When HEp-2 cells were treated with 0.1 N HCl, the cytoplasmic speckled staining of the index serum was markedly decreased, suggesting that the reactive antigen was soluble. Western blot analysis showed a reactive approximately 97 kDa protein in a saline soluble protein preparation from HeLa cells. Mass spectrometric analysis of the excised 97 kDa band that was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell extracts identified GRASP-1 as a possible target. The index serum and anti-GRASP-1 antibodies colocalized to structures in the cytoplasm of HEp-2 cells. Synthetic peptides representing the full-length GRASP-1 protein were used to identify reactive epitopes. Like many other cytoplasmic autoantigens, GRASP-1 has numerous coiled-coil domains throughout the protein with the exception of short segments at the amino and carboxyl terminus."
High-content functional screen to identify proteins that correct F508del-CFTR function,19088066,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19088066,"Cystic Fibrosis is caused by mutations in CFTR, with a deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del-CFTR) representing the most common mutation. The F508del-CFTR protein exhibits a trafficking defect and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we describe the development of a high-content screen based on a functional assay to identify proteins that correct the F508del-CFTR defect. Using a HEK293 MSR GripTite cell line that stably expresses F508del-CFTR, we individually co-expressed approximately 450 unique proteins fused to the Cl(-)-sensitive YFP(H148Q/I152L) mutant. We then tested correction of F508del-CFTR function by the CI(-)/l(-) exchange method following stimulation with forskolin/IBMX/genistein, using quantitative recordings in multiple individual cells with a high-content (high-throughput) Cellomics KSR imaging system. Using this approach, we identified several known and novel proteins that corrected F508del-CFTR function, including STAT1, Endothelin 1, HspA4, SAPK substrate protein 1, AP2M1, LGALS3/galectin-3, Trk-fused gene, Caveolin 2, PAP/REG3alpha, and others. The ability of these correctors to rescue F508del-CFTR trafficking was then validated by demonstrating their enhancement of maturation (appearance of band C) and by cell surface expression of F508del-CFTR bearing HA tag at the ectodomain using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. These data demonstrate the utility of high-content analyses for identifying proteins that correct mutant CFTR and discover new proteins that stimulate this correction. This assay can also be utilized for RNAi screens to identify inhibitory proteins that block correction of F508del-CFTR, small molecule, and peptide screens."
HSP70 inhibition reverses cell adhesion mediated and acquired drug resistance in multiple myeloma,18503584,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18503584,"Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a super family of highly conserved molecular chaperone proteins, which are induced in response to stress. HSP70 has been demonstrated to inhibit apoptosis induced by a number of chemotherapeutic agents. Previous investigations have suggested the development of drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM) cells after adhesion to stroma. This study used MM cell lines and primary plasma cells to determine if HSP70 had a role in development of chemo resistance. Adhesion of MM cells to either bone marrow stromal cells or fibronectin (FN) enhanced HSP70 expression. Inhibition of the HSP70 expression decreased 8226 cell adhesion to stroma or FN and induced more apoptosis in FN-adhered 8226 cells than in suspension cultures at 24 h. Further, HSP70 inhibitors enhanced melphalan-induced apoptosis and reversed melphalan-induced cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) phenotype. In addition, compared to parental cells, KNK-437, a heat shock factor inhibitor caused more apoptosis in melphalan-resistant 8226/LR5 cells and sensitized them to melphalan. Primary CD138 positive cells showed high expression of HSPA4 mRNA, and KNK-437 caused apoptosis in these cells. In conclusion, our data suggest inhibition of HSP70, reduced adhesion and caused apoptosis of both acquired and de novo drug resistant MM cells."
Novel underlying genetic markers for asthenozoospermia due to abnormal spermatogenesis and reproductive organ inflammation,38476923,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38476923,"Asthenozoospermia, a male fertility disorder, has a complex and multifactorial etiology. Moreover, the effectiveness of different treatments for asthenozoospermia remains uncertain. Hence, by using bioinformatics techniques, the present study aimed to determine the underlying genetic markers and pathogenetic mechanisms associated with asthenozoospermia due to abnormal spermatogenesis and inflammation of the reproductive tract. GSE160749 dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and the data were filtered to obtain 1336 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with asthenozoospermia. These DEGs were intersected with the epithelial mesenchymal transition datasets to yield 61 candidate DEGs. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were performed, and the results revealed that these candidate DEGs were significantly enriched in the enzyme-linked receptor pathway and the thyroid hormone pathway. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed to identify the key genes of asthenozoospermia. A total of five key genes were identified, among which 
SOX9
 was significantly upregulated, while 
HSPA4
, 
SMAD2
, 
HIF1A
 and 
GSK3B
 were significantly downregulated. These findings were validated by conducting reverse transcription-quantitative PCR for clinical semen samples. To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms, a regulatory network of transcription factors and miRNA-mRNA interactions was predicted. The expression levels of 
HSPA4
, 
SMAD2
 and 
GSK3B
 were positively associated with several related etiological genes of asthenozoospermia. In total, five key genes were closely associated with the level and type of immune cells; higher levels of activated B cells and CD8 T cells were observed in asthenozoospermia. Thus, the findings of the present study may provide clues to determine the underlying novel diagnostic genetic markers and treatment strategies for asthenozoospermia."
The Association Between Heat-Shock Protein Polymorphisms and Prognosis in Lung Cancer Patients Treated With Platinum-Based Chemotherapy,32848724,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32848724,"Objective:
        

      
      Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers and the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. Platinum-based chemotherapy plays an important role in lung cancer treatment, but the therapeutic effect varies from person to person. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been reported to be associated with the survival time of lung cancer patients, which may be a potential biomarker in lung cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms and the prognosis in lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      We performed genotyping in 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of HSP genes and Rho family genes of 346 lung cancer patients by SequenomMassARRAY. We used Cox proportional hazard models, state and plink to analyze the associations between SNPs and the prognosis of lung cancer patients.
    





          Results:
        

      
      We found that the polymorphisms of 
HSPB1
 rs2070804 and 
HSPA4
 rs3088225 were significantly associated with lung cancer survival (
p
=0.015, 
p
=0.049*, respectively). We also discovered the statistically significant differences between rs2070804 with age, gender, histology and stage, rs3088225 with gender and stage, which can affect lung cancer prognosis.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      The results of our study suggest that 
HSPB1
 rs2070804 (G>T) and 
HSPA4
 rs3088225 (A>G) may be useful biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy."
Rhamnolipids functionalized AgNPs-induced oxidative stress and modulation of toxicity pathway genes in cultured MCF-7 cells,26057247,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26057247,"Rhamnolipids extracted from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain JS-11 were utilized for synthesis of stable silver nanoparticles (Rh-AgNPs). The Rh-AgNPs (23 nm) were characterized by Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The cytotoxicity assays suggested significant decrease in viability of Rh-AgNPs treated human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells, compared with normal human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMN) cells. Flow cytometry data revealed 1.25-fold (p<0.05) increase in the fluorescence of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) at 0.25 μg/mL. However, at Rh-AgNPs concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 μg/mL, much lesser fluorescence was noticed, which is attributed to cell death. Results with the fluorescent probe Rh123 demonstrated change in inner mitochondrial membrane and dissipation of membrane potential. The cell cycle analysis suggested 19.9% (p<0.05) increase in sub-G1 peak with concomitant reduction in G1 phase at 1 μg/mL of Rh-AgNPs, compared to 2.7% in untreated control. The real-time RT(2) Profiler™ PCR array data elucidated the overexpression of seven oxidative stress and DNA damage pathways genes viz. BAX, BCl2, Cyclin D1, DNAJA1, E2F transcription factor 1, GPX1 and HSPA4, associated with apoptosis signaling, proliferation and carcinogenesis, pro inflammatory and heat shock responses in Rh-AgNPs treated cells. Thus, the increased ROS production, mitochondrial damage and appearance of sub-G1 (apoptotic) population suggested the anti-proliferative activity, and role of oxidative stress pathway genes in Rh-AgNPs induced death of MCF-7 cancer cells."
Hsp110 expression changes in rat primary myocardial cells exposed to heat stress in vitro,23315814,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23315814,"We investigated and described the kinetics of heat shock protein (Hsp) 110 expression and distribution in rat primary myocardial cells exposed to heat stress in vitro. After incubation at 37°C for 72 h, myocardial cells were heat stressed at 42°C for 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 120, 240, 360, and 480 min. Significant increases in aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase enzymatic activities in the myocardial cell culture media were observed during heat stress, suggesting that the integrity of the myocardial cells was altered. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the expressed Hsp110 was constitutively localized in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei in small amounts characterized by a granular pattern. Nuclear Hsp110 levels increased significantly after 240 min of heat stress compared with levels in the control. The overall levels of Hsp110 expression increased significantly after 20 min. After 240 min, Hsp110 levels were approximately 1.2-fold higher than those in the control. Increasing levels of hsp110 messenger RNA detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were observed after 20 min of heat stress, and the levels peaked with a 10-fold increase after 240 min of heat stress. These results indicate that the expression of Hsp110 in primary myocardial cells in vitro is sensitive to hyperthermic stress and that Hsp110 is involved in the potential acquisition of thermotolerance after heat stress. Therefore, Hsp110 might play a fundamental role in opposing and alleviating heat-induced damage caused by hyperthermic stress in primary myocardial cells."
Integrated Analysis of Immunity- and Ferroptosis-Related Biomarker Signatures to Improve the Prognosis Prediction of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,33391356,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33391356,"Background:
        

      
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor with high mortality and poor prognoses around the world. Ferroptosis is a new form of cell death, and some studies have found that it is related to cancer immunotherapy. The aim of our research was to find immunity- and ferroptosis-related biomarkers to improve the treatment and prognosis of HCC by bioinformatics analysis.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      First, we obtained the original RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) expression data and corresponding clinical data of HCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA) database and performed differential analysis. Second, we used immunity- and ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to perform a computational difference algorithm and Cox regression analysis. Third, we explored the potential molecular mechanisms and properties of immunity- and ferroptosis-related DEGs by computational biology and performed a new prognostic index based on immunity- and ferroptosis-related DEGs by multivariable Cox analysis. Finally, we used HCC data from International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) data to perform validation.
    





          Results:
        

      
      We obtained 31 immunity (
p
 < 0.001)- and 14 ferroptosis (
p
 < 0.05)-related DEGs correlated with overall survival (OS) in the univariate Cox regression analysis. Then, we screened five immunity- and two ferroptosis-related DEGs (HSPA4, ISG20L2, NRAS, IL17D, NDRG1, ACSL4, and G6PD) to establish a predictive model by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analyses demonstrated a good performance of the seven-biomarker signature. Functional enrichment analysis including Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) revealed that the seven-biomarker signature was mainly associated with HCC-related biological processes such as nuclear division and the cell cycle, and the immune status was different between the two risk groups.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      Our results suggest that this specific seven-biomarker signature may be clinically useful in the prediction of HCC prognoses beyond conventional clinicopathological factors. Moreover, it also brings us new insights into the molecular mechanisms of HCC."
The antimicrobial protein S100A12 identified as a potential autoantigen in a subgroup of atopic dermatitis patients,30728947,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30728947,"Background:
        

      
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex heterogeneous chronic inflammatory skin disease. Specific IgE antibodies against autoantigens have been observed in a subgroup of AD patients, however, little is known about IgG-auto-reactivity in AD. To investigate the presence of autoreactive IgG antibodies, we performed autoantibody profiling of IgG in patients with AD of different severities and in healthy controls (HC).
    





          Methods:
        

      
      First, we performed an untargeted screening in plasma samples from 40 severe AD (sAD) patients and 40 HC towards 1152 protein fragments on planar antigen microarrays. Next, based on the findings and addition of more fragments, a targeted antigen suspension bead array was designed to profile a cohort of 50 sAD patients, 123 patients with moderate AD (mAD), and 84 HC against 148 protein fragments representing 96 unique proteins.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Forty-nine percent of the AD patients showed increased IgG-reactivity to any of the four antigens representing keratin associated protein 17-1 (KRTAP17-1), heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 4 (HSPA4), S100 calcium binding proteins A12 (S100A12), and Z (S100Z). The reactivity was more frequent in the sAD patients (66%) than in those with mAD (41%), whereas only present in 25% of the HC. IgG-reactivity to S100A12, a protein including an antimicrobial peptide, was only observed in AD patients (13/173).
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Autoantibody profiling of IgG-reactivity using microarray technology revealed an autoantibody-based subgroup in patients with AD. The four identified autoantigens and especially S100A12 could, if characterized further, increase the understanding of different pathogenic mechanisms behind AD and thereby enable better treatment."
Network Pharmacology and Bioinformatics Approach Reveals the Therapeutic Mechanism of Action of Baicalein in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,30891079,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30891079,"Liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for the greatest proportion of these deaths. Baicalein, a flavonoid isolated from the root of 
Scutellariae radix
, is considered a potential candidate to treat HCC. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, a network pharmacological approach was combined with microarray data (GSE95504) acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to reveal the therapeutic mechanisms of action of baicalein at a systemic level. We identified 38 baicalein targets and 76 differently expressed genes (DEGs) following treatment with baicalein, including 55 upregulated and 21 downregulated genes. The DEGs were significantly enriched in the biological functions of apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and PERK-mediated unfolded protein response. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and topological screening revealed a core module of PPIs including two baicalein targets, 
TP53
 and 
CDK1
, and two downregulated DEGs, 
HSPA1A
 and 
HSPA1B
. Expression and survival data for these genes in the module derived from Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) were subjected to Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival and disease-free survival. Overexpression of 
CDK1
, 
BRCA1
, 
TUBB
, 
HSPA1A
, 
HSPA1B
, and 
HSPA4
 was associated with significantly worse overall survival, while overexpression of 
CDK1
, 
CLU7
, 
BRCA1
, and 
TUBB
 was associated with significantly worse disease-free survival. These data suggest that baicalein exerts therapeutic effects against HCC via a PPI network involving TP53, CDK1, HSPA1A, and HSPA1B."
Profile of the Spleen Transcriptome in Beef Steers with Variation in Gain and Feed Intake,27504120,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27504120,"We have previously identified components of the immune system contributing to feed intake and gain in both the rumen and small intestine of beef steers. In this study, we examined the spleen, a major lymphatic organ near the digestive tract, to determine whether it was also influencing individual feed efficiency status through immune responses. Animals (n = 16) that were divergent for gain and intake were selected for tissue sampling. The spleen transcriptomes were evaluated by microarray. A total of 1216 genes were identified as differentially expressed. Genes were over-represented in Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways including biological regulation, protein folding, cell communication, immune systems process, response to stress, and RNA metabolic process. Several stress response or heat shock genes including HSPH1, HSPA1A, HSPA4, DNAJB4, DNAJA4, etc., were identified as a stress response functional gene cluster in the low gain-low intake animals. These genes were up-regulated amongst the low gain-low intake animals compared to all other groups. Canonical pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes included the coagulation system, extrinsic prothrombin activation, protein ubiquitination, unfolded protein response, and aldosterone signaling in epithelial cells. An analysis of expressed copy number variable (CNV) genes in the spleen produced some of the same genes and gene families that were differentially expressed. Our data suggests the splenic contribution to some of the underlying variation among gain and intake within this group of animals may be a result of immune function and stress response. In addition, some of the differences in immune response functions may be related to gene copy number."
Mining the key regulatory genes of chicken inosine 5'-monophosphate metabolism based on time series microarray data,26075067,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26075067,"IMP (inosine 5'-monophosphate) is a compound that enhances the flavor of poultry meat. IMP has become a new breeding trait to improve poultry meat quality. We tried to identify several potential regulatory genes, and construct their predicted regulatory relationships. Time series gene expression profiles of thigh muscle tissues of Rugao chicken, a famous indigenous breed in China, were performed for analysis of genes that are co-expressed or correlated with the concentration of IMP. We found 15 crucial co-expression genes, which are Hspa2, Pten, Gabpa, Bpi, Mkl1, Srf, Cd34, Hspa4, Etv6, Bmpr2, Gde1, Igfbp5, Cd28, Pecam1 and Gja1, that may directly or indirectly regulate IMP metabolism. Eventually, we computed the correlation coefficient between 19 IMP Genes and 15 CGs (15 co-expression genes), and we identified and constructed a predicted regulation network. In conclusion, variation of IMP concentration was primarily connected with the muscle development process. During this process, 15 CGs were identified that may have significant influence on IMP metabolism. In particular, Bmpr2, Pten and co-expression genes correlated with Entpd8 might play important roles in regulating IMP de novo synthesis, decomposition and salvage synthesis."
"Strong expression of heat shock proteins in growth plate cartilage, an immunohistochemical study of HSP28, HSP70 and HSP110",9108202,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9108202,"Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are known to be increased in response to stresses. Our immunohistochemical investigations revealed the strong expression of a wide range of HSPs in the chondrocytes of the tibial growth plate cartilage from young rats. HSP28 and HSP70 are expressed in the upper part of the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate cartilage. HSP110 are found from the proliferating zone to the hypertrophic zone. On the other hand, application of the TUNEL method has already shown apoptotic DNA fragmentation in the lower part of the proliferating zone. From then one, HSP expression in the chondrocytes may be correlated with apoptosis, but its possible relation with the different events occurring during the calcification process cannot be excluded."
Heat shock protein and heat shock factor expression in sperm: relation to oligozoospermia and varicocele,20096881,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20096881,"Purpose:
        

      
      Varicocele may be associated with normozoospermia or oligozoospermia. Much controversy still exists regarding the diagnosis, management and pathophysiology of spermatogenesis alterations associated with varicocele. The increased temperature induced by varicocele and stress in general may activate heat shock proteins and heat shock factors with a protective function in cells. We analyzed the expression of 5 heat shock proteins and heat shock factors in the sperm of men with normozoospermia and oligozoospermia with or without varicocele.
    





          Materials and methods:
        

      
      We performed a prospective study between June 2008 and February 2009 at an academic clinic in 117 consecutive patients with varicocele and 68 controls without varicocele. Four groups were based on the presence/absence of varicocele and normozoospermia/oligozoospermia. Subjects were studied by history, physical examination, scrotal Doppler ultrasound, semen analysis, reproductive hormone plasma levels and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in RNA extracted from ejaculated sperm to analyze HSP90, HSPA4, HSF1, HSF2 and HSFY expression.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Increased HSPA4, HSF1 and HSF2 were observed in the sperm of men with varicocele and in those with oligozoospermia. Levels were maximum when the 2 conditions were present. Increased HSP90 was observed in oligozoospermia cases independent of varicocele. HSFY was up-regulated only in patients with varicocele, especially those with normozoospermia.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      To our knowledge we describe for the first time the expression of different heat shock proteins and heat shock factors in ejaculated sperm. While some of these proteins are up-regulated in men with oligozoospermia and varicocele, HSFY is up-regulated only in the presence of varicocele and especially in men with normozoospermia. This suggests that it may be a molecular marker of an adequate or inadequate response to the damaging effect of varicocele on spermatogenesis."
Screening of autoantibodies as potential biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma by using T7 phase display system,22018955,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22018955,"Background:
        

      
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common tumors worldwide. Autoantibodies to tumor-associated proteins in the serum profile, as new biomarkers, may improve the early detection of HCC.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      In this study, we interrogated a HCC cDNA T7 phage library for tumor-associated proteins using biopan enrichment techniques with HCC patient and normal sera. The enrichment of tumor-associated proteins after biopanning was tested using plaque assay and immunochemical detection. The putative tumor-associated phage clones were collected for PCR and sequencing analysis. Identities of those selected sequences were revealed through the sequence BLAST program. The identified phage-expressed proteins were then used to develop phage protein ELISA to measure matching autoantibodies using 70 HCC patients, 50 chronic hepatitis patients, and 70 normal serum samples. The logistic regression model and leave-one-out validation were used to evaluate predictive accuracies with a single marker as well as with combined markers.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Twenty-six phage-displayed proteins have sequence identity with known or putative tumor-associated proteins. Immunochemical reactivity of patient sera with phage-expressed proteins showed that the autoantibodies to phage-expressed protein CENPF, DDX3, HSPA4, HSPA5, VIM, LMNB1, and TP53 had statistical significance in HCC patients. Measurements of the seven autoantibodies combined in a logistic regression model showed that combined measurements of these autoantibodies was more predictive of disease than any single antibody alone, underscoring the importance of identifying multiple potential markers.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      Autoantibody in the serum profiling is a promising approach for early detection and diagnosis of HCC. The panel of autoantibodies appears preferable to achieve superior accuracy rather than an autoantibody alone, and may have significant relevance to tumor biology, novel drug development, and immunotherapies."
Molecular cloning and expression analysis of five heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family members in Lateolabrax maculatus with Vibrio harveyi infection,27908666,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27908666,"Heat shock proteins 70 (HSP70s) are molecular chaperones that aid in protection against environmental stress. In this study, we cloned and characterized five members of the HSP70 family (designated as HSPa1a, HSC70-1, HSC70-2, HSPa4 and HSPa14) from Lateolabrax maculatus using rapid amplification cDNA ends (RACE). Multiple sequence alignment and structural analysis revealed that all members of the HSP70 family had a conserved domain architecture, with some distinguishing features unique to each HSP70. Quantitative real-time (qPCR) analysis revealed that all members of the HSP70 family were ubiquitously and differentially expressed in all major types of tissues, including testicular tissue. This indicated that HSP70s have vital and conserved biological functions, and may also function in the development of germinal cells. The expression of mRNA of the five HSP70 family members mRNA expression was significantly increased in the head kidney, intestine and gill after Vibrio harveyi challenge, suggesting that HSP70s play an important role in the immune response."
Hspa4l-deficient mice display increased incidence of male infertility and hydronephrosis development,16923965,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16923965,"The Hspa4l gene, also known as Apg1 or Osp94, belongs to the HSP110 heat shock gene family, which includes three genes encoding highly conserved proteins. This study shows that Hspa4l is expressed ubiquitously and predominantly in the testis. The protein is highly expressed in spermatogenic cells, from late pachytene spermatocytes to postmeiotic spermatids. In the kidney, the protein is restricted to cortical segments of distal tubules. To study the physiological role of this gene in vivo, we generated mice deficient in Hspa4l by gene targeting. Hspa4l-deficient mice were born at expected ratios and appeared healthy. However, approximately 42% of Hspa4l(-/-) male mice suffered from fertility defects. Whereas the seminiferous tubules of Hspa4l(-/-) testes contained all stages of germ cells, the number of mature sperm in the epididymis and sperm motility were drastically reduced. The reduction of the sperm count was due to the elimination of a significant number of developing germ cells via apoptosis. No defects in fertility were observed in female mutants. In addition, 12% of null mutant mice developed hydronephrosis. Concentrations of plasma and urine electrolytes in Hspa4l(-/-) mice were similar to wild-type values, suggesting that the renal function was not impaired. However, Hspa4l(-/-) animals were preferentially susceptible to osmotic stress. These results provide evidence that Hspa4l is required for normal spermatogenesis and suggest that Hspa4l plays a role in osmotolerance."
Age-related differential responses to curcumin-induced apoptosis during the initiation of colon cancer in rats,19095035,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19095035,"Curcumin is a widely-used dietary supplement and a chemopreventive agent for various cancers. Pre-clinical chemopreventive studies rarely consider the effect of aging. We previously reported that unlike young animals, curcumin is ineffective in middle-aged rats for colon chemoprevention. This study investigated whether resistance to apoptosis during cancer initiation contributes to this age-dependent effect. Young, middle-aged, and old F344 rats were fed either curcumin (0.6%) or control diet. Colonic apoptosis was evaluated 0, 8, and 16 h after azoxymethane (AOM) injection. Colonic Hsp70 mRNA levels, caspase-9 activity, cell proliferation, and crypt morphology were measured. In AOM-treated rats, only middle-aged rats were resistant to curcumin-induced apoptosis whereas cell proliferation was reduced by curcumin in all ages. Curcumin-induced apoptosis was mediated by caspase-9 in young but not older rats. Transcriptional Hsp70 expression was induced in only young rats and was suppressed by curcumin. Therefore, the age-related difference in curcumin chemoprevention is due to a differential response in induction of apoptosis. The mitochondria-dependent pathway seems to mediate curcumin-induced apoptosis in young but not older animals. Hsp70 expression was not related with resistance to curcumin-induced apoptosis. Understanding age-related differences in the apoptotic response may lead to improved translation from pre-clinical animal studies to humans."
Overexpression of heat shock protein HSP90AA1 and translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane TOM34 in HCV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma: A pilot study,30521791,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30521791,"Objective:
        

      
      Identification of new molecular markers to enhance early diagnosis, prognosis and/or treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a need. TOM34 (34 kDa-translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane) protein expression deregulation has demonstrated to be involved in the growth of many cancers. Here, we aimed at evaluating serum TOM34 and some heat shock proteins (HSPA4, HSPA1B, and HSP90AA1) expressions in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis and HCV-induced HCC relative to controls and correlating these expressions to the clinicopathological data.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Serum specimens were collected from 90 patients with HCV associated complications (30 cirrhotic, 30 early HCC and 30 late HCC) and 60 controls. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed for relative quantification of the four target genes using the Livak method. In silico network analysis was also executed to explore the contribution of the genes in liver cancer.
    





          Results:
        

      
      The serum TOM34 and HSP90AA1 transcripts were significantly upregulated in HCC patients compared to cirrhotic ones with more up-regulation in late HCC patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed the optimum cutoff value of 0.625 corresponding to 71.7% sensitivity and 56.7% specificity, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.705 to discriminate HCC from cirrhotic groups (P = .002). In multivariate analysis, ordination plot showed obvious demarcation between the study groups caused by the higher levels of TOM34 among other variables.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      TOM34 and its partner HSP90AA1 might be used as a potential biomarker for monitoring HCV-induced HCC progression in the Egyptian population. Future large-scale validation studies are warranted."
Induction of the HSP110/105 family in the rat hippocampus in cerebral ischemia and ischemic tolerance,11435793,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11435793,"Recently, the authors isolated a novel gene of the HSP110 family, ischemia responsive protein 94 kDa (irp94), and demonstrated the expression of this gene after transient forebrain ischemia. In the current study, the authors investigated the expression profiles of all HSP110 family members including hsp110/105 and osp94/apg-1, after transient forebrain ischemia using rat four-vessel occlusion model. Among three members of the HSP110 family, induction of hsp110/105 was the most prominent after ischemia. hsp110/105 mRNA expression was clearly enhanced from 4 to 24 hours after a 6-minute or longer ischemic period. First, hsp110/105 mRNA expression was induced in the dentate gyrus, and later in the pyramidal layer. HSP110/105 protein expression also was enhanced by a 6-minute or longer period of ischemia. Profiles of HSP110/105 expression after ischemia were similar to those of inducible HSP70. After transient forebrain ischemia for 10 minutes, HSP110/105 protein was induced in the dentate gyrus and the CA3 pyramidal layer, but not in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. However, 6 minutes of ischemia induced the HSP110/105 protein, as well as the HSP70 protein, in the CA1 region. CA1 pyramidal neurons expressing HSP110/105 acquired tolerance against subsequent severe ischemia. In conclusion, HSP110/105 showed the most prominent induction after ischemia among the three HSP110 gene family members. Colocalization of HSP110/105 and HSP70 in the CA1 neurons that acquired tolerance suggested that induced HSP110/105 might contribute to ischemic tolerance together with HSP70."
Hsp110 is a bona fide chaperone using ATP to unfold stable misfolded polypeptides and reciprocally collaborate with Hsp70 to solubilize protein aggregates,23737532,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737532,"Structurally and sequence-wise, the Hsp110s belong to a subfamily of the Hsp70 chaperones. Like the classical Hsp70s, members of the Hsp110 subfamily can bind misfolding polypeptides and hydrolyze ATP. However, they apparently act as a mere subordinate nucleotide exchange factors, regulating the ability of Hsp70 to hydrolyze ATP and convert stable protein aggregates into native proteins. Using stably misfolded and aggregated polypeptides as substrates in optimized in vitro chaperone assays, we show that the human cytosolic Hsp110s (HSPH1 and HSPH2) are bona fide chaperones on their own that collaborate with Hsp40 (DNAJA1 and DNAJB1) to hydrolyze ATP and unfold and thus convert stable misfolded polypeptides into natively refolded proteins. Moreover, equimolar Hsp70 (HSPA1A) and Hsp110 (HSPH1) formed a powerful molecular machinery that optimally reactivated stable luciferase aggregates in an ATP- and DNAJA1-dependent manner, in a disaggregation mechanism whereby the two paralogous chaperones alternatively activate the release of bound unfolded polypeptide substrates from one another, leading to native protein refolding."
Identification of cancer stem cell-related biomarkers in lung adenocarcinoma by stemness index and weighted correlation network analysis,32221746,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32221746,"Background:
        

      
      Accounting for tumor heterogeneity, cancer stem cells (CSC) are involved in tumor metastasis, relapse, and drug resistance. Genes regulating CSC characteristics in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) were explored and validated in this study.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      The mRNA stemness index (mRNAsi) of more than 500 LUAD cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were calculated using a one-class logistic regression machine learning algorithm based on the mRNA expression of pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny. mRNAsi-related key genes were identified by weighted correlation network analysis. The expression levels and prognostic roles of key genes were analyzed in Oncomine, PrognoScan, and Kaplan-Meier plotter databases, and validated using data from our center.
    





          Results:
        

      
      The mRNAsi was significantly higher in LUAD compared with normal lung tissues. LUAD patients of advanced stage exhibited a higher mRNAsi and worse overall survival (OS). Eight key genes were identified: heat shock 70 kDa protein 4 (HSPA4), cell division cycle associated 7 (CDCA7), cell division cycle 20 (CDC20), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), CAP-GLY domain containing linker protein 1 (CLIP1), cyclin B1 (CCNB1), H2A histone family, member X (H2AFX), and Bloom syndrome, RecQ helicase-like (BLM). These genes were differentially expressed in various types of malignancies and validated in the LUAD cases. LUAD patients with low expression of CDC20, CDK1, CCNB1, H2AFX, or BLM had a significantly better OS, whereas OS was reduced for patients with low expression of CLIP1. In addition, the expression of CDCA7 did not significantly impact the OS of LUAD patients. The protein-protein interaction networks evaluated by STRING demonstrated strong relationships between these key genes, which were validated in our cases.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      The mRNAsi was significantly higher in LUAD compared with normal samples. Eight mRNAsi-related key genes were associated with prognosis and the cell cycle, and were strongly correlated with each other and differentially expressed in tumor and normal samples. We provide a new strategy for exploring stemness-related genes in LUAD cases."
Differential molecular and cellular responses of GLP-1 secreting L-cells and pancreatic alpha cells to glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity,26027945,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26027945,"Knowledge of the effects of glucotoxic and lipotoxic environments on proglucagon producing intestinal L cells and pancreatic alpha cells is limited compared with pancreatic beta cells. This study compares the in vitro responses of these cell types to hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Glucose (30 mM) and palmitate (0.5mM) reduced GLUTag and MIN6 cell viability while alpha TC1 cells were sensitive only to lipotoxicity. Consistent with this, Cat mRNA expression was substantially higher in GLUTag and alpha TC1 cells compared to MIN6 cells. Glucose and palmitate reduced GLUTag cell secretory function while hypersecretion of glucagon was apparent from alpha TC1 cells. Glucose exposure increased transcription of Cat and Sod2 in MIN6 and GLUTag cells respectively while it decreased transcription of Cat and Gpx1 in alpha TC1 cells. Palmitate increased transcription of Cat and Sod2 in all three cell lines. Upregulation of antioxidant enzyme expression by palmitate was accompanied by an increase in Nfkb1 transcription, indicative of activation of defence pathways. Lipotoxicity activated ER stress response, evident from increased Hspa4 mRNA level in GLUTag and MIN6 cells. Glucose and palmitate-induced DNA damage and apoptosis, with substantially smaller effects in alpha TC1 cells. Thus alpha cells are resistant to gluco- and lipotoxicity, partly reflecting higher expression of genes involved in antioxidant defence. In contrast, intestinal L cells, like beta cells, are prone to gluco- and lipotoxicity, possibly contributing to abnormalities of GLP-1 secretion in type 2 diabetes."
"Enteral glutamine infusion modulates ubiquitination of heat shock proteins, Grp-75 and Apg-2, in the human duodenal mucosa",24449167,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24449167,"Glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in the human body, plays several important roles in the intestine. Previous studies showed that glutamine may affect protein expression by regulating ubiquitin-proteasome system. We thus aimed to evaluate the effects of glutamine on ubiquitinated proteins in human duodenal mucosa. Five healthy male volunteers were included and received during 5 h, on two occasions and in a random order, either an enteral infusion of maltodextrins alone (0.25 g kg(-1) h(-1), control), mimicking carbohydrate-fed state, or maltodextrins with glutamine (0.117 g kg(-1) h(-1), glutamine). Endoscopic duodenal biopsies were then taken. Total cellular protein extracts were separated by 2D gel electrophoresis and analyzed by an immunodetection using anti-ubiquitin antibody. Differentially ubiquitinated proteins were then identified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization MS/MS. Five proteins were differentially ubiquitinated between control and glutamine conditions. Among these proteins, we identified two chaperone proteins, Grp75 and hsp74. Grp75 was less ubiquitinated after glutamine infusion compared with control. In contrast, hsp74, also called Apg-2, was more ubiquitinated after glutamine. In conclusion, we provide evidence that glutamine may regulate ubiquitination processes of specific proteins, i.e., Grp75 and Apg-2. Grp75 has protective and anti-inflammatory properties, while Apg-2 indirectly regulates stress-induced cell survival and proliferation through interaction with ZO-1. Further studies should confirm these results in stress conditions."
Novel candidate genes of the PARK7 interactome as mediators of apoptosis and acetylation in multiple sclerosis: An in silico analysis,29100048,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29100048,"Background:
        

      
      currently only 4 studies have explored the potential role of PARK7's dysregulation in MS pathophysiology Currently, no study has evaluated the potential role of the PARK7 interactome in MS.
    





          Objective:
        

      
      The aim of our study was to assess the differential expression of PARK7 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclears (PBMCs) donated from MS versus healthy patients using data mining techniques.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      The PARK7 interactome data from the GDS3920 profile were scrutinized for differentially expressed genes (DEGs); Gene Enrichment Analysis (GEA) was used to detect significantly enriched biological functions.
    





          Results:
        

      
      27 differentially expressed genes in the MS dataset were detected; 12 of these (NDUFA4, UBA2, TDP2, NPM1, NDUFS3, SUMO1, PIAS2, KIAA0101, RBBP4, NONO, RBBP7 AND HSPA4) are reported for the first time in MS. Stepwise Linear Discriminant Function Analysis constructed a predictive model (Wilk's λ = 0.176, χ
2
 = 45.204, p = 1.5275e
-10
) with 2 variables (TIDP2, RBBP4) that achieved 96.6% accuracy when discriminating between patients and controls. Gene Enrichment Analysis revealed that induction and regulation of programmed / intrinsic cell death represented the most salient Gene Ontology annotations. Cross-validation on systemic lupus erythematosus and ischemic stroke datasets revealed that these functions are unique to the MS dataset.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Based on our results, novel potential target genes are revealed; these differentially expressed genes regulate epigenetic and apoptotic pathways that may further elucidate underlying mechanisms of autorreactivity in MS."
Elucidation of the Inhibitory Mechanisms of Nipponoparmelia laevior Lichen Extract against Influenza A (H1N1) Virus through Proteomic Analyses,31280524,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31280524,"Lichens contain diverse bioactive secondary metabolites with various chemical and biological properties, which have been widely studied. However, details of the inhibitory mechanisms of their secondary metabolites against influenza A virus (IAV) have not been documented. Here, we investigated the antiviral effect of lichen extracts, obtained from South Korea, against IAV in MDCK cells. Of the lichens tested, 
Nipponoparmelia laevior
 (LC24) exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect against IAV infection. LC24 extract significantly increased cell viability, and reduced apoptosis in IAV-infected cells. The LC24 extract also markedly reduced (~ 3.2 logfold) IAV mRNA expression after 48 h of infection. To understand the antiviral mechanism of LC24 against IAV, proteomic (UPLC-HDMS
E
) analysis was performed to compare proteome modulation in IAV-infected (V) vs. mock (M) and LC24+IAV (LCV) vs. V cells. Based on Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), LC24 inhibited IAV infection by modulating several antiviral-related genes and proteins (HSPA4, HSPA5, HSPA8, ANXA1, ANXA2, HIF-1α, AKT1, MX1, HNRNPH1, HNRNPDL, PDIA3, and VCP) via different signaling pathways, including HIF-1α signaling, unfolded protein response, and interferon signaling. These molecules were identified as the specific biomarkers for controlling IAV in vitro and further confirmation of their potential against IAV in vivo is required. Our findings provide a platform for further studies on the application of lichen extracts against IAV."
Identification and characterization of genes related to the development of breast muscles in Pekin duck,22451153,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22451153,"Pekin Duck is world-famous for its fast growth, but its breast muscle development is later and breast muscle content is lower compared with other muscular ducks. Therefore, it is very important to discover the genetic mechanism between breast muscle development and relative gene expression in Pekin duck. In current study, the genes which have relationships with breast muscle development were identified by suppression subtractive hybridization. A total of 403 positive clones were sequenced and 257 unigenes were obtained. The expression of 23 genes were analyzed in the breast muscle of 2-, 4-, 6-, 8- week old Pekin ducks. The results showed that unknown clone A233, C83 and C99 showed descending tendency as age increased; KBTBD10, HSPA8, MYL1, ZFP622, MARCH4, Nexilin, FABP4 and MUSTN1 had high expression levels at 6 weeks old; WAC, NT5C3, HSP90AA1, MRPL33, KLF6, TSNAX, CDC42EP3, HSPA4, TRAK1, NR2F2, HAUS1 and IGF1 had high expression levels at 8 weeks and showed ascending tendency as age increased. Expression of these 23 genes were also analyzed in breast muscle, leg muscle, heart, kidney, liver, muscular stomach and sebum cutaneum in 4-8-week old Pekin duck and results showed that most of these genes had high expression in breast muscle, leg muscle and heart."
"Decrease in level of APG-2, a member of the heat shock protein 110 family, in murine brain following systemic administration of kainic acid",11522319,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11522319,"APG-2 belongs to the heat shock protein 110 family. Although kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures are known to elicit expression of inducible heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the brain, no investigation has been carried out on the APG-2 level after excitatory amino acid-induced seizures. By means of an immunoblot assay, we determined the levels of HSP70 and APG-2 in discrete brain structures of mice after a single intraperitoneal injection of KA or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA). APG-2 level was significantly decreased in frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum three days after the administration of KA, while HSP70 level was increased in these regions following the administration. In any of these regions, APG-2 levels were returned to the control levels 10 days after the administration. However, no significant changes were observed in levels of both HSP70 and APG-2 in hypothalamus, midbrain, medulla-pons, and cerebellum of the mice. By contrast, NMDA administration did not significantly affect both levels in any of the regions examined. These findings indicate that the transient decrease in APG-2 expression is one of the intracellular events elicited by signals peculiar to KA, but not by those peculiar to NMDA, in telencephalon of murine brain."
"Molecular Mechanisms of Toxicity and Cell Damage by Chemicals in a Human Pancreatic Beta Cell Line, 1.1B4",27253232,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27253232,"Objectives:
        

      
      Mechanisms of toxicity and cell damage were investigated in novel clonal human pancreatic beta cell line, 1.1B4, after exposure to streptozotocin, alloxan, ninhydrin, and hydrogen peroxide.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Viability, DNA damage, insulin secretion/content, [Ca]i, and glucokinase/hexokinase, mRNA expression were measured by MTT assay, comet assay, radioimmunoassay, fluorometric imaging plate reader, enzyme-coupled photometry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Chemicals significantly reduced 1.1B4 cell viability in a time/concentration-dependent manner. Chronic 18-hour exposure decreased cellular insulin, glucokinase, and hexokinase activities. Chemicals decreased transcription of INS, GCK, PCSK1, PCSK2, and GJA1 (involved in secretory function). Insulin release and [Ca]i responses to nutrients and membrane-depolarizing agents were impaired. Streptozotocin and alloxan up-regulated transcription of genes, SOD1 and SOD2 (antioxidant enzymes). Ninhydrin and hydrogen peroxide up-regulated SOD2 transcription, whereas alloxan and hydrogen peroxide increased CAT transcription. Chemicals induced DNA damage, apoptosis, and increased caspase 3/7 activity. Streptozotocin and alloxan decreased transcription of BCL2 while increasing transcription of BAX. Chemicals did not affect transcription of HSPA4 and HSPA5 and nitrite production.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      1.1B4 cells represent a useful model of human beta cells. Chemicals impaired 1.1B4 cell secretory function and activated antioxidant defense and apoptotic pathways without activating endoplasmic reticulum stress response/nitrosative stress."
"Expression of an HSP110 family, ischemia-responsive protein (irp94), in the rat brain after transient forebrain ischemia",10928558,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10928558,"The transcriptional expression of an ischemia responsive protein (irp94) in the hippocampus of rats was analyzed by Northern blotting. A transient forebrain ischemia was induced in the rats by temporary occluding of the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCAs) for various periods, and then reperfusion. Among the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, and the cerebellum and hippocampus, the maximum mRNA expression of irp94 was at the occipital lobe, and the minimum was at the parietal lobe following ten min of forebrain ischemia. The irp94 mRNA expression reached a maximum fifteen min after the transient ischemia. From twenty min on after the ischemia its expression decreased. After a ten-min ischemia and the following reperfusion, irp94 mRNA expression gradually increased in the first twelve h, and then decreased. The expression pattern was like that of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, Erp72, but not that of the cytosol chaperone, hsp72. In addition, when intracellular ATP was depleted with antimycin A the mRNA level of irp94 increased in a thyrocyte cell culture model. The results suggest that irp94, like a molecular chaperone, may play a role in protecting the cell against external stimulation, especially after a transient forebrain ischemia. Although future studies of irp94 will be required to clarify the interactions with other intracellular factors inducing ischemia or showing molecular chaperone activity, what is offered here is an insight into its functional role as a component of stress response in neurons that should be considered as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of ischemia."
Integrating Bioinformatics and Drug Sensitivity Analyses to Identify Molecular Characteristics Associated with Targeting Necroptosis in Breast Cancer and their Clinical Prognostic Significance,37653627,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37653627,"Background:
        

      
      Breast cancer accounts for over 1.8 million new cases worldwide annually, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are imperative to prevent mortality. Necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is thought to be a critical pathway for cancer cell apoptosis, yet, its relationship with breast cancer progression and molecular mechanisms remains largely unexplored.
    





          Objectives:
        

      
      Our study aims to investigate the molecular characteristics and clinical prognostic value of necroptosis-related genes in breast cancer using a comprehensive approach that involves integrated bioinformatics analysis along with drug sensitivity assessment.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Transcriptional, clinical, and tumor mutation burden (TMB) data related to breast cancer from the TCGA and GEO databases were integrated, and the necroptosis gene set was downloaded from the GSEA website for analysis. The screening conditions were set as adjusted P<0.05 and |log2FC(fold change)|>0.585 to screen for differential expression genes related to breast cancer necroptosis. Survival prognosis analysis was conducted on breast cancer necroptosis genes. Further analysis was conducted on prognosis-related necroptosis genes, including immune infiltration analysis and GO/KEGG enrichment analysis, to explore the potential biological functions and signaling pathway mechanisms of breast cancer necroptosis genes. Drug sensitivity screening was conducted on the prognosis-related necroptosis to identify potential drugs that target the promotion of necroptosis gene expression, and ultimately, single-gene analysis was performed on the core target genes obtained.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Through integrated bioinformatics analysis, 29 differentially expressed mRNAs related to BRCA-Necroptosis were identified, including 18 upregulated mRNAs and 11 downregulated mRNAs. In addition, single-factor analysis of differential genes showed that the expression of HSPA4, PLK1, TNFRSF1B, FLT3, and LEF1 was closely related to BRCA survival prognosis. Based on the expression of these genes, a breast cancer prognosis model was constructed, and it was found that the area under the curve (AUC) of the curve of the risk genes for necroptosis was the largest, indicating that these genes have a certain clinical predictive significance for the occurrence and prognosis of BRCA. Additionally, there were significant differences in clinical characteristics of BRCA patients with different necroptosis gene expressions. Furthermore, GSVA and immune infiltration analysis revealed that Necroptosis-DEGs mainly affect the occurrence and progression of BRCA by participating in immune functions such as APC co-inhibition, APC co-stimulation, CCR, checkpoint, as well as infiltrating immune cells such as B cells naive, plasma cells, and T cells CD8. Moreover, the necroptosis gene group column chart indicated a 1-year survival rate of 0.979, a 3-year survival rate of 0.883, and a 5-year survival rate of 0.774. The necroptosis gene group and column chart are important indicators for evaluating BRCA prognosis. Finally, drug sensitivity screening of BRCA-Necroptosis genes showed that compounds such as A-770041, AC220, AP-24534, Bexarotene, and BMS-509744 have certain effects as potential targeted drugs for the treatment of BRCA necroptosis genes.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      Necroptosis genes are implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of breast cancer and are thought to impact the prognosis and response to drug treatments in individuals with BRCA. Consequently, understanding the role of these genes in breast cancer may aid in identifying more precise and efficacious therapeutic targets."
Expression of material mRNA in the hypothalamus and frontal cortex in a rat model of fatal hypothermia,21377399,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21377399,"Diagnosis of fatal hypothermia is considered to be difficult in forensic practice because of the lack of any specific pathological findings. The mechanism that induces abnormal behavior such as undressing or hiding during the state of hypothermia has not been clarified. In order to solve these problems, we made a rat model of fatal hypothermia and investigated the expression of some mRNA within the hypothalamus and the frontal cortex. The expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 family, member A1 (ALDH6A1), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CARTPT), desmin (DES), heat shock 70kDa protein 4 (HSPA4), serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A), opioid receptor, delta 1 (OPRD1) and transthyretin (TTR) supposedly related to fatal hypothermia was determined using quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of OPRD1 in the hypothalamus of fatal hypothermia was significantly increased, while the expression of TTR within the frontal cortex was significantly decreased compared to that in the control. These findings suggest that OPRD1 and TTR may be involved in thermoregulation at a low ambient temperature."
Transcriptomic and functional pathway features were associated with survival after pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer,32905537,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32905537,"Pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been proposed as a surrogate endpoint for the prediction of long-term survival in breast cancer (BC); however, an increased pCR rate has not clearly correlated with improved survival. We hypothesized that some transcriptomic and functional pathway features correlate with survival after pCR in BC. We utilized 2 published NAC cohorts, 105 women with gene expression data before, ""Baseline"", and that changed during NAC, ""Delta"", and TCGA database with 1068 BC patients to investigate the relationship between the efficacy of NAC and survival utilizing differentially expressed-mRNAs, construction and analysis of the mRNA-hub gene network, and functional pathway analysis. In mRNA expression profiling, 
S100A8
 was a gene involved in survival after pCR in Baseline and 
NDP
 was a gene involved in recurrence after pCR in Delta. In functional pathway analysis, we found multiple pathways involved in survival after pCR. In mRNA-hub gene analysis, 
HSP90AA1

We demonstrated the genes and functional pathway features associated with pCR and survival utilizing the bioinformatics approach to public BC cohorts. Some genes involved in recurrence after pCR due to NAC also served as prognostic factors in primary BC."
Gene expression meta-analysis identifies VDAC1 as a predictor of poor outcome in early stage non-small cell lung cancer,21297950,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21297950,"Background:
        

      
      The bioenergetic status of non-small cell lung cancer correlates with tumour aggressiveness. The voltage dependent anion channel type 1 (VDAC1) is a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, regulates mitochondrial ATP/ADP exchange suggesting that its over-expression could be associated with energy dependent processes including increased proliferation and invasiveness. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an in vivo gene-expression meta-analysis of surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using 602 individual expression profiles, to examine the impact of VDAC1 on survival.
    





          Methodology/principal findings:
        

      
      High VDAC1 expression was associated with shorter overall survival with hazard ratio (HR) = 0.6639 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4528 to 0.9721), p = 0.035352 corresponding to 52 versus 101 months. VDAC1 predicted shorter time to recurrence and was shown to be an independent prognostic factor compared with histology, gender, age, nodal stage and tumour stage in a Cox multivariate analysis. Supervised analysis of all the datasets identified a 6-gene signature comprising HNRNPC, HSPA4, HSPA9, UBE2D2, CSNK1A1 and G3BP1 with overlapping functions involving regulation of protein turnover, RAS-RAF-MEK pathway and transcription. VDAC1 predicted survival in breast cancer and myeloma and an unsupervised analysis revealed enrichment of the VDAC1 signature in specific subsets.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      In summary, gene expression analysis identifies VDAC1 gene expression as a predictor of poor outcome in NSCLC and other cancers and is associated with dysregulation of a conserved set of biological pathways, which may be causally associated with aggressive tumour behaviour."
Integrated analysis of genome-wide miRNAs and targeted gene expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and relation to prognosis,32375686,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32375686,"Background:
        

      
      Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide and in China. We know miRNAs influence gene expression in tumorigenesis, but it is unclear how miRNAs affect gene expression or influence survival at the genome-wide level in ESCC.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      We performed miRNA and mRNA expression arrays in 113 ESCC cases with tumor/normal matched tissues to identify dysregulated miRNAs, to correlate miRNA and mRNA expressions, and to relate miRNA and mRNA expression changes to survival and clinical characteristics.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Thirty-nine miRNAs were identified whose tumor/normal tissue expression ratios showed dysregulation (28 down- and 11 up-regulated by at least two-fold with P < 1.92E-04), including several not previously reported in ESCC (miR-885-5p, miR-140-3p, miR-708, miR-639, miR-596). Expressions of 16 miRNAs were highly correlated with expressions of 195 genes (P < 8.42E-09; absolute rho values 0.51-0.64). Increased expressions of miRNA in tumor tissue for both miR-30e* and miR-124 were associated with increased survival (P < 0.05). Similarly, nine probes in eight of 818 dysregulated genes had RNA expression levels that were nominally associated with survival, including NF1, ASXL1, HSPA4, TGOLN2, BAIAP2, EZH2, CHAF1A, SUPT7L.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Our characterization and integrated analysis of genome-wide miRNA and gene expression in ESCC provides insights into the expression of miRNAs and their relation to regulation of RNA targets in ESCC tumorigenesis, and suggest opportunities for the future development of miRs and mRNAs as biomarkers for early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis in ESCC."
Assessment of the risk of blastomere biopsy during preimplantation genetic diagnosis in a mouse model: reducing female ovary function with an increase in age by proteomics method,24156634,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24156634,"Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is important for screening genetic and chromosome mutations in embryos so that the efficiency of assisted reproductive treatment can be increased and birth defects can be decreased; however, some studies have reported a risk from this technology as well as other assisted reproductive technologies. We have developed a blastomere biopsy mouse model to assess the potential effects of blastomere biopsy that was one key procedure in PGD on the fertility of female mice at different ages. We showed that female fertility was decreased in the biopsied mouse model with an increase in age. Moreover, the ovarian weight, serum hormone levels, and the number of primordial, primary, preantral, and antral stage follicles were also decreased in the middle-aged biopsied mouse model. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, we did proteomics analysis on ovarian tissues from puberty biopsied and nonbiopsied mice of the 23 differentially expressed proteins that were screened for in both groups, 3 proteins (PSMB8, ALDH1A1, and HSPA4) were selected and identified by Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR methods, which showed the 3 proteins to regulate 12 cellular pathways. Furthermore, these three proteins were shown to be located in ovarian tissues, and the dynamic changes of expression profiling in middle-aged biopsied and nonbiopsied mice were demonstrated. The present study showed that blastomere biopsy technology impairs fertility when mice are middle-aged, which possibly resulted in abnormal expression profiling of PSMB8, ALDH1A1, and HSPA4 proteins. Thus, additional studies should be performed to assess the overall risk of blastomere biopsies during PGD procedures."
"Expression of APG-2 protein, a member of the heat shock protein 110 family, in developing rat brain",10566957,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10566957,"APG-2 protein is a member of the heat shock protein 110 family, and it is thought to play an important role in the maintenance of neuronal functions under physiological and stress conditions. However, neither the tissue-distribution of APG-2 protein nor developmental change of its expression has been studied at the protein level. Therefore, we generated an antiserum against APG-2 protein and studied expression of this protein in rat brain and other tissues by use of the Western blot method. The results showed a high expression of APG-2 protein in various regions of the central nervous system (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain, hypothalamus, cerebellum, medulla pons, and spinal cord) throughout the entire postnatal stage. Similarly, a high level of APG-2 protein was detected in the whole brain of rat embryos and in adult rat tissues such as liver, lung, spleen, and kidney. In contrast, its expression in heart was high at postnatal days 1 and 3, but thereafter drastically decreased to a low level. Furthermore, APG-2 protein was detected in neuronal primary cultures prepared from rat cerebral cortex, and its level did not change notably during neuronal differentiation. These results show that APG-2 protein is constitutively expressed in various tissues and also in neuronal cells throughout the entire embryonic and postnatal period. suggesting that it might play an important role in these tissues under non-stress conditions."
"Interactome networks between the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), the human metapneumovirus (ΗMPV), and their host: In silico investigation and comparative functional enrichment analysis",31988005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31988005,"Background and objectives:
        

      
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are leading causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in non-immunocompetent subjects, yet the mechanisms by which they induce their pathogenicity differ significantly and remain elusive. In this study we aimed at identifying the gene interaction networks between the HRSV, HMPV respiratory pathogens and their host along with the different cell-signaling pathways associated with the above interactomes.
    





          Materials and methods:
        

      
      The Viruses STRING database (http://viruses.string-db.org/) was used for the identification of the host-viruses interaction networks. The two lists of the predicted functional partners were entered in the FunRich tool (http://www.funrich.org) for the construction of the Venn diagram and the comparative Funcional Enrichment Analysis (FEA) with respect to biological pathways. The sets of the common and unique human genes identified in the two networks were also analyzed. The computational predictions regarding the shared human genes in the host-HRSV and the host-HMPV interactomes were further evaluated via the analysis of the GSE111732 dataset. miRNA transcriptomics data were mapped to gene targets using the miRNomics pipeline of the GeneTrail2 database (https://genetrail2.bioinf.uni-sb.de/).
    





          Results:
        

      
      Eleven out of twenty predicted human genes were common in the two interactomes (TLR4, SOCS3, SFXN1, AKT1, SFXN3, LY96, SFXN2, SOCS7, CISH, SOCS6, SOCS1). FEA of these common genes identified the kit receptor and the GH receptor signaling pathways as the most significantly enriched annotations. The remaining nine genes of the host-HRSV and the host-HMPV interaction networks were the IFIH1, DDX58, NCL, IRF3, STAT2, HSPA4, CD209, KLF6, CHKA and the MYD88, SOCS4, SOCS2, SOCS5 AKT2, AKT3, SFXN4, SFXN5 and TLR3 respectively. Distinct cell-signaling pathways were enriched per interactome. The comparative FEA highlighted the association of the host-HRSV functional partners with the negative regulation of RIG-I/MDA5 signaling. The analysis with respect to miRNAs mapping to gene targets of the GSE111732 dataset indicated that nine out of the eleven common host genes are either enriched or depleted in the sample sets (HRSV or HMPV infected) as compared with the reference set (non-infected), although with no significant scores.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      We have identified both shared and unique host genes as members of the HRSV and HMPV interaction networks. The disparate human genes likely contribute to distinct responses in airway epithelial cells."
"Human mitochondrial chaperone (mtHSP70) and cysteine desulfurase (NFS1) bind preferentially to the disordered conformation, whereas co-chaperone (HSC20) binds to the structured conformation of the iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein (ISCU)",23940031,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23940031,"Human ISCU is the scaffold protein for mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis and transfer. NMR spectra have revealed that ISCU populates two conformational states; that is, a more structured state (S) and a partially disordered state (D). We identified two single amino acid substitutions (D39V and N90A) that stabilize the S-state and two (D39A and H105A) that stabilize the D-state. We isolated the two constituent proteins of the human cysteine desulfurase complex (NFS1 and ISD11) separately and used NMR spectroscopy to investigate their interaction with ISCU. We found that ISD11 does not interact directly with ISCU. By contrast, NFS1 binds preferentially to the D-state of ISCU as does the NFS1-ISD11 complex. An in vitro Fe-S cluster assembly assay showed that [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters are assembled on ISCU when catalyzed by NFS1 alone and at a higher rate when catalyzed by the NFS1-ISD11 complex. The DnaK-type chaperone (mtHSP70) and DnaJ-type co-chaperone (HSC20) are involved in the transfer of clusters bound to ISCU to acceptor proteins in an ATP-dependent reaction. We found that the ATPase activity of mtHSP70 is accelerated by HSC20 and further accelerated by HSC20 plus ISCU. NMR studies have shown that mtHSP70 binds preferentially to the D-state of ISCU and that HSC20 binds preferentially to the S-state of ISCU."
"Gene expression profiling of primary human articular chondrocytes in high-density micromasses reveals patterns of recovery, maintenance, re- and dedifferentiation",20433912,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20433912,"The high-density micromass culture has been widely applied to study chondrocyte cell physiology and pathophysiological mechanisms. Since an integrated image has not been established so far, we analyzed the phenotypic alterations of human articular chondrocytes in this model on the broad molecular level. Freshly isolated chondrocytes were assembled as micromasses and maintained up to 6 weeks in medium containing human serum. Formation of cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) was evaluated by histological and immunohistochemical staining. At 0, 3 and 6 weeks, chondrocyte micromasses were subjected to gene expression analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays and real-time RT-PCR. Micromasses developed a cartilaginous ECM rich in proteoglycans and type II collagen. On gene expression level, time-dependent expression patterns was observed. The induction of genes associated with cartilage-specific ECM (COL2A1 and COL11A1) and developmental signaling (GDF5, GDF10, ID1, ID4 and FGFR1-3) indicated redifferentiation within the first 3 weeks. The repression of genes related to stress response (HSPA1A and HSPA4), apoptotic events (HYOU1, NFKBIA and TRAF1), and degradation (MMP1, MMP10 and MMP12) suggested a recovery of chondrocytes. Constant expression of other chondrogenic (ACAN, FN1 and MGP) and hypertrophic markers (COL10A1, ALPL, PTHR1 and PTHR2) indicated a pattern of phenotypic maintenance. Simultaneously, the expression of chondrogenic growth (BMP6, TGFA, FGF1 and FGF2) and transcription factors (SOX9, EGR1, HES1 and TGIF1), and other cartilage ECM-related genes (COMP and PRG4) was consistently repressed and expression of collagens related to dedifferentiation (COL1A1 and COL3A1) was steadily induced indicating a progressing loss of cartilage phenotype. Likewise, a steady increase of genes associated with proliferation (GAS6, SERPINF1, VEGFB and VEGFC) and apoptosis (DRAM, DPAK1, HSPB, GPX1, NGFRAP1 and TIA1) was observed. Sequence and interplay of identified expression patterns suggest that chondrocyte micromass cultures maintain a differentiated phenotype up to 3 weeks in vitro and might be useful for studying chondrocyte biology, pathophysiology and differentiation. Cultivation longer than 6 weeks leads to progressing dedifferentiation of chondrocytes that should be considered on long-term evaluations."
"Identification of an overexpressed gene, HSPA4L, the product of which can provoke prevalent humoral immune responses in leukemia patients",17588478,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17588478,"Objective:
        

      
      To identify leukemia-associated antigens, we applied the serological identification of antigens by the recombinant expression cloning (SEREX) method to a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patient who achieved a cytogenetic response to interferon-alpha.
    





          Materials and methods:
        

      
      Immunoscreening of the cDNA library was performed with sera from a CML patient. Two isolated antigens were used to evaluate the expression pattern using Northern blot analysis and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were also performed for serological analysis.
    





          Results:
        

      
      We identified 14 positive clones, representing five different antigens. Of these, two genes were further validated. One (clone 70) was the human polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase 1 (PNPT1), which is the type I interferon (alpha/beta-responsive gene). The mRNA of clone 70 was ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues. The other gene (clone 57) was the heat shock 70-kDa protein 4-like (HSPA4L), which is a member of the heat shock protein 110 family, whose mRNA is strongly expressed in normal human testis and overexpressed in leukemia cells. Seroactivity against HSPA4L was detected in 6 of 9 acute myeloid leukemia patients, 4 of 10 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, 9 of 11 CML patients, and none of 10 healthy volunteers. Leukemia patients had higher titer of the antibodies against the protein than healthy volunteers.
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      These results suggest that HSPA4L, a member of heat shock protein, is highly expressed by leukemia cells, and elicit humoral immune responses in leukemia patients, and it might be a potential target for antileukemia therapy and an antigen-specific immunotherapy for leukemia."
Characterization of the constitutive pig ovary heat shock chaperone machinery and its response to acute thermal stress or to seasonal variations,23018186,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23018186,"Reduced oocyte competence causes the lower fertility reported in domestic sows during the warm months of the year. Somatic cells express heat shock proteins (HSPs) to protect themselves from damage caused by thermal stress. HSPs are classified as molecular chaperones and control the correct folding of newly synthesized or damaged proteins. The present work performed a comprehensive survey of the different components of the heat shock chaperone machinery in the pig ovary, which included the HSP40, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP110 families, as well as heat shock factors (HSF) 1 and 2. Pig ovarian follicles constitutively expressed different members of these families; therefore, we examined their ability to respond to heat stress. In order to take into account the role of the complex follicular architecture, whole pig ovaries were exposed to 41.5°C for 1 h. This exposure significantly disrupted oocyte maturation and determined the upregulation of the HSP70, HSP40, HSPH1, HSPA4, HSPA4L, HSF1, and HFS2 genes, whereas expression levels of HSP90A and HSP90B, as well as those of genes unrelated to heat stress were not altered. Unexpectedly HSP and HSF expression levels changed only in oocytes but not in cumulus cells. Cumulus-oocyte complexes isolated from ovaries collected in summer showed the same pattern as those collected in winter. We conclude that the HSP chaperone machinery is constitutively fully operational in the pig ovary. However, following thermal stimuli or seasonal variations, cumulus cell HS-related gene expression remains unchanged, and only oocytes activate a response, suggesting why this mechanism is insufficient to preserve their competence both in vitro and in vivo."
Multistate proteomics analysis reveals novel strategies used by a hibernator to precondition the heart and conserve ATP for winter heterothermy,21914784,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21914784,"The hibernator's heart functions continuously and avoids damage across the wide temperature range of winter heterothermy. To define the molecular basis of this phenotype, we quantified proteomic changes in the 13-lined ground squirrel heart among eight distinct physiological states encompassing the hibernator's year. Unsupervised clustering revealed a prominent seasonal separation between the summer homeotherms and winter heterotherms, whereas within-season state separation was limited. Further, animals torpid in the fall were intermediate to summer and winter, consistent with the transitional nature of this phase. A seasonal analysis revealed that the relative abundances of protein spots were mainly winter-increased. The winter-elevated proteins were involved in fatty acid catabolism and protein folding, whereas the winter-depleted proteins included those that degrade branched-chain amino acids. To identify further state-dependent changes, protein spots were re-evaluated with respect to specific physiological state, confirming the predominance of seasonal differences. Additionally, chaperone and heat shock proteins increased in winter, including HSPA4, HSPB6, and HSP90AB1, which have known roles in protecting against ischemia-reperfusion injury and apoptosis. The most significant and greatest fold change observed was a disappearance of phospho-cofilin 2 at low body temperature, likely a strategy to preserve ATP. The robust summer-to-winter seasonal proteomic shift implies that a winter-protected state is orchestrated before prolonged torpor ensues. Additionally, the general preservation of the proteome during winter hibernation and an increase of stress response proteins, together with dephosphorylation of cofilin 2, highlight the importance of ATP-conserving mechanisms for winter cardioprotection."
"Cloning of human cDNAs for Apg-1 and Apg-2, members of the Hsp110 family, and chromosomal assignment of their genes",10524232,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10524232,"In mice, the Hsp110/SSE family is composed of the heat shock protein (Hsp)110/105, Apg-1 and Apg-2. In humans, however, only the Hsp110/105 homolog has been identified as a member, and two cDNAs, Hsp70RY and HS24/p52, potentially encoding proteins structurally similar to, but smaller than, mouse Apg-2 have been reported. To clarify the membership of Hsp110 family in humans, we isolated Apg-1 and Apg-2 cDNAs from a human testis cDNA library. The human Apg-1 was 100% and 91.8% identical in length and amino acid (aa) sequence, respectively, to mouse Apg-1. Human Apg-2 was one aa shorter than and 95.5% identical in sequence to mouse Apg-2. In ECV304, human endothelial cells Apg-1 but not Apg-2 transcripts were induced in 2 h by a temperature shift from 32 degrees C to 39 degrees C. As found in mice, the response was stronger than that to a 37-42 degrees C shift. The human Apg-1 and Apg-2 genes were mapped to the chromosomal loci 4q28 and 5q23.3-q31.1, respectively, by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. We isolated cDNA and genomic clones encompassing the region critical for the difference between Apg-2 and HS24/p52. Although the primer sets used were derived from the sequences common to both cDNAs, all cDNA and genomic clones corresponded to Apg-2. Using a similar approach, the relationship between Apg-2 and Hsp70RY was assessed, and no clone corresponding to Hsp70RY was obtained. These results demonstrated that the Hsp110 family consists of at least three members, Apg-1, Apg-2 and Hsp110 in humans as well as in mice. The significance of HS24/p52 and Hsp70RY cDNAs previously reported remains to be determined."
Altered Expression of High Molecular Weight Heat Shock Proteins after OCT4B1 Suppression in Human Tumor Cell Lines,26862520,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26862520,"Objective:
        

      
      OCT4B1, a novel variant of OCT4, is expressed in cancer cell lines and tis- sues. Based on our previous reports, OCT4B1 appears to have a crucial role in regulating apoptosis as well as stress response [heat shock proteins (HSPs)] pathways. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of OCT4B1 silencing on the expression of high molecular weight HSPs in three different human tumor cell lines.
    





          Materials and methods:
        

      
      In this experimental study, OCT4B1 expression was suppressed in AGS (gastric adenocarcinoma), 5637 (bladder tumor) and U-87MG (brain tumor) cell lines using RNAi strategy. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array was em- ployed for expression level analysis and the fold changes were calculated using RT2 Pro- filer PCR array data analysis software version 3.5.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Our data revealed up-regulation of HSPD1 (from HSP60 family) as well as HSPA14, HSPA1L, HSPA4, HSPA5 and HSPA8 (from HSP70 family) following OCT4B1 knock-down in all three cell lines. In contrast, the expression of HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1 (from HSP90 family) as well as HSPA1B and HSPA6 (from HSP70 family) was down-regulated under similar conditions. Other stress-related genes showed varying ex- pression pattern in the examined tumor cell lines.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      Our data suggest a direct or indirect correlation between the expression of OCT4B1 and HSP90 gene family. However, OCT4B1 expression was not strongly corre- lated with the expression of HSP70 and HSP60 gene families."
Altered expression of heat shock protein 110 family members in mouse hippocampal neurons following trimethyltin treatment in vivo and in vitro,18601936,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18601936,"The heat shock protein (Hsp) 110 family is composed of HSP105, APG-1, and APG-2. As the response of these proteins to neuronal damage is not yet fully understood, in the present study, we assessed their expression in mouse hippocampal neurons following trimethyltin chloride (TMT) treatment in vivo and in vitro. Although each of these three Hsps had a distinct regional distribution within the hippocampus, a low level of all of them was observed in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus in naïve animals. TMT was effective in markedly increasing the level of these Hsps in the granule cell layer, at least 16h to 4days after the treatment. In the dentate granule cell layer on day 2 after TMT treatment, HSP105 was expressed mainly in the perikarya of NeuN-positive cells (intact neurons); whereas APG-1 and APG-2 were predominantly found in NeuN-negative cells (damaged neurons as evidenced by signs of cell shrinkage and condensation of chromatin). Assessments using primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons exposed to TMT revealed that whereas HSP105 was observed in intact neurons rather than in damaged neurons, APG-1 and APG-2 were detected in both damaged neurons and intact neurons. Taken together, our data suggest that APG-1 and APG-2 may play different roles from HSP105 in neurons damaged by TMT."
The ischemia-responsive protein 94 (Irp94) activates dendritic cells through NK cell receptor protein-2/NK group 2 member D (NKR-P2/NKG2D) leading to their maturation,18178852,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18178852,"Tumor recognition and killing, the uptake of released immunogenic substrate, and the generation of immunity are crucial aspects of dendritic cell (DC)-mediated antitumor immune response. In the context of direct tumoricidal activity, we have recently shown NK cell receptor protein-2 (NKR-P2)/NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) as a potent activation receptor on rat DCs. The activation of DCs with agonistic anti-NKR-P2 mAb, the binding of soluble NKR-P2 to the AK-5 tumor, and DC maturation with fixed AK-5 cells led us to identify a putative NKR-P2 ligand on the AK-5 cell surface. In this study we have shown that the AK-5 tumor-derived ischemia-responsive protein-94 (Irp94, a 110 kDa Hsp family member) acts as a functional ligand for NKR-P2 on DCs and enhances Irp94-NKR-P2 interaction-dependent tumor cell apoptosis via NO. Surface expression of Irp94 was also found on tumors of diverse origin in addition to AK-5. Furthermore, the Th1-polarizing cytokine IL-12, produced from Irp94-ligated BMDCs, augments NK cell cytotoxicity. Irp94-NKR-P2 interaction drives the maturation of BMDCs by up-regulating MHC class II, CD86, and CD1a and also induces autologous T cell proliferation, which displays a crucial state of DCs for adaptive antitumor immune response. These functional properties of Irp94 reside in the COOH terminus subdomain but not in the NH2 terminus ATPase domain of Irp94. We also show the involvement of PI3K, ERK, protein kinase C, phosphatases, and NF-kappaB translocation as downstream mediators of DCs activation upon NKR-P2 ligation with Irp94. Our studies demonstrate for the first time a novel role of a 110-kDa heat shock protein (Irp94) as a ligand for NKR-P2 on DCs, which in turn executes both innate and adaptive immunity."
The effects of nonyl phenoxypolyethoxyl ethanol on cell damage pathway gene expression in SK-NSH cells,26552463,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26552463,"Background/aims:
        

      
      Most pesticide formulations contain both chief and additive ingredients. But, the additives may not have been tested as thoroughly as the chief ingredients. The surfactant, nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol (NP40), is an additive frequently present in pesticide formulations. We investigated the effects of NP40 and other constituents of a validamycin pesticide formulation on cell viability and on the expression of genes involved in cell damage pathways.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      The effects of validamycin pesticide ingredients on cell viability and of NP40 on the mRNA expression of 80 genes involved in nine key cellular pathways were examined in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line.
    





          Results:
        

      
      The chemicals present in the validamycin pesticide formulation were cytotoxic to SK-N-SH cells and NP40 showed the greatest cytotoxicity. A range of gene expression changes were identified, with both up- and down-regulation of genes within the same pathway. However, all genes tested in the necrosis signaling pathway were down-regulated and all genes tested in the cell cycle checkpoint/arrest pathway were up-regulated. The median fold-change in gene expression was significantly higher in the cell cycle checkpoint/arrest pathway than in the hypoxia pathway category (p = 0.0064). The 70 kDa heat shock protein 4 gene, within the heat shock protein/unfolded protein response category, showed the highest individual increase in expression (26.1-fold).
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      NP40 appeared to be particularly harmful, inducing gene expression changes that indicated genotoxicity, activation of the cell death (necrosis signaling) pathway, and induction of the 70 kDa heat shock protein 4 gene."
Mechanisms Involved in Therapeutic Effects of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Based on Systems Biology and Structural Bioinformatics Approaches,38322303,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38322303,"Objective:
        

      
      Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most frequent oral cancer, constituting more than 90% of all oral carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate of OSCC patients is not satisfactory, and therefore, there is an urgent need for new practical therapeutic approaches besides the current therapies to overcome OSCC. 
Scutellaria baicalensis
 Georgi (SBG) is a plant of the family Lamiaceae with several pharmaceutical properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. Previous studies have demonstrated the curative effects of SBG in OSCC.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      A systems biology approach was conducted to identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in OSCC patients with a dismal prognosis compared to OSCC patients with a favorable prognosis. A protein interaction map (PIM) was built based on DEMs targets, and the hub genes within the PIM were indicated. Subsequently, the prognostic role of the hubs was studied using Kaplan-Meier curves. Next, the binding affinity of SBG's main components, including baicalein, wogonin, oroxylin-A, salvigenin, and norwogonin, to the prognostic markers in OSCC was evaluated using molecular docking analysis.
    





          Results:
        

      
      Survival analysis showed that overexpression of CAV1, SERPINE1, ACTB, SMAD3, HMGA2, MYC, EIF2S1, HSPA4, HSPA5, and IL6 was significantly related to a poor prognosis in OSCC. Besides, molecular docking analysis demonstrated the Δ
G
binding
 and inhibition constant values between SBG's main components and SERPINE1, ACTB, HMGA2, EIF2S1, HSPA4, and HSPA5 were as <-8.00 kcal/mol and nanomolar concentration, respectively. The most salient binding affinity was observed between wogonin and SERPINE1 with a criterion of Δ
G
binding
 < -10.02 kcal/mol.
    





          Conclusion:
        

      
      The present results unraveled potential mechanisms involved in therapeutic effects of SBG in OSCC based on systems biology and structural bioinformatics analyses."
ShRNA-mediated gene silencing of heat shock protein 70 inhibits human colon cancer growth,21725599,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21725599,"Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), a chaperone involved in tumor progression, is overexpressed in various human tumors. However, its role in colon cancer progression is not completely understood. In the present study, two shRNA plasmid vectors against Hsp70 were constructed and stably transfected into the colon cancer cell line HT29 to determine the effect of Hsp70 on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution and cell apoptosis in HT29 cells in vitro, and its effect on xenograft tumor growth and apoptosis in vivo. Cell proliferation was determined using MTT assay. The results revealed that Hsp70 silencing efficiently inhibited the growth of HT29 cells in culture, induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, and significantly increased apoptosis. Moreover, stable clones from the Hsp70 shRNA-2 vector suppressed xenograft tumor growth and enhanced apoptosis in vivo compared with a mock and vector control group. In conclusion, specific Hsp70 shRNA silencing may inhibit colon cancer growth, indicating that Hsp70 silencing is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of colon cancer."
Systematic Proteomic Identification of the Heat Shock Proteins (Hsp) that Interact with Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα) and Biochemical Characterization of the ERα-Hsp70 Interaction,27483141,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27483141,"Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are known to associate with estrogen receptors (ER) and regulate ER-mediated cell proliferation. Historically, the studies in this area have focused on Hsp90. However, some critical aspects of the Hsp-ERα interactions remain unclear. For example, we do not know which Hsps are the major or minor ERα interactants and whether or not different Hsp isoforms associate equally with ERα. In the present study, through a quantitative proteomic method we found that 21 Hsps and 3 Hsp cochaperones were associated with ERα in human 293T cells that were cultured in a medium containing necessary elements for cell proliferation. Four Hsp70s (Hsp70-1, Hsc70, Grp75, and Grp78) were the most abundant Hsps identified to associate with ERα, followed by two Hsp90s (Hsp90α and Hsp90β) and three Hsp110s (Hsp105, HspA4, and HspA4L). Hsp90α was found to be 2-3 times more abundant than Hsp90β in the ERα-containing complexes. Among the reported Hsp cochaperones, we detected prostaglandin E synthase 3 (p23), peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP5 (FKBP51), and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CHIP (CHIP). Studies with the two most abundant ERα-associated Hsps, Hsp70-1 and Hsc70, using human breast cancer MCF7 cells demonstrate that the two Hsps interacted with ERα in both the cytoplasm and nucleus when the cells were cultured in a medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and phenol red. Interestingly, the ERα-Hsp70-1/Hsc70 interactions were detected only in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus under hormone starvation conditions, and stimulation of the starved cells with 17β-estradiol (E2) did not change this. In addition, E2-treatment weakened the ERα-Hsc70 interaction but had no effect on the ERα-Hsp70-1 interaction. Further studies showed that significant portions of Hsp70-1 and Hsc70 were associated with transcriptionally active chromatin and inactive chromatin, and the two Hsps interacted with ERα in both forms of the chromatins in MCF7 cells."
Overexpression of Apg-2 increases cell proliferation and protects from oxidative damage in BaF3-BCR/ABL cells,20198334,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20198334,"Apg-2, a mammalian heat-shock protein belonging to the heat-shock protein 110 (Hsp110) family, was previously found to be overexpressed in BaF3-BCR/ABL cells that were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through our comparative proteomics study. The expression of Apg-2 in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells and its role have not been investigated, forming the basis for this study. BaF3-MIGR1 and BaF3-BCR/ABL cell lines stably overexpressing Apg-2 were established and exposed to 50 microM H2O2 for 10 min. Western blot analysis of Apg-2 expression confirmed that H2O2 treatment significantly up-regulated Apg-2 expression. Apg-2 overexpression elevated BaF3-BCR/ABL cell proportions in S and G2/M phase, increased cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro. Moreover, BaF3-MIGR1 and BaF3-BCR/ABL cells were exposed to 50 microM H2O2 in the absence or presence of Apg-2 overexpression and induction of H2AX phosphorylation, the reporters of DNA damage were assessed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Results showed that exposure to H2O2 induced H2AX phosphorylation in BaF3-MIGR1 cells, but no increase was observed in BaF3-BCR/ABL cells. Together, the data indicate that Apg-2 is overexpressed and overexpression of Apg-2 in BaF3-BCR/ABL cells increases cell proliferation and protects cells from oxidative damage, which may play an important role in CML carcinogenesis and progression."
Escherichia coli-induced temporal and differential secretion of heat-shock protein 70 and interleukin-1β by human fetal membranes in a two-compartment culture system,25600910,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25600910,"Introduction:
        

      
      Escherichia coli is recognized as an etiological bacteria associated with chorioamnionitis and the preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes. This pathological condition induces pro-inflammatory cytokines and degradative metalloproteinases, which are considered biological markers secreted in an acute stage of infection. Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are an important component of the innate immunity response and are found in different pathological conditions. They have not been previously measured in human fetal membranes in response to infectious conditions. We hypothesized that the choriodecidual tissue and amniotic epithelium secreted temporal and differential Hsp-60, Hsp-70, and interleukin (IL)-1β mediated by E. coli infection.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      Fetal membranes were mounted in a two-compartment culture system and infected with two passes of live E. coli at different doses (10², 10⁴, 10⁵, and 10⁶ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL) and intervals of incubation (3, 6, and 24 h). The culture medium was collected, and Hsp-60, Hsp-70, and IL-1β were assessed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.
    





          Results:
        

      
      After 3 and 6 h of infection, E. coli induced an increase in Hsp-70 secretion in the choriodecidual tissue. However, after 24 h of incubation, Hsp-70 was downregulated and we observed an increase in IL-1β secretion. By contrast, E. coli induced a lower Hsp-60 secretion in the amnion compared to Hsp-70.
    





          Discussion:
        

      
      Human fetal membranes responded actively to E. coli infection, with an increase in Hsp-70 during the first hours of infection. After 24 h, there was an increase in the liberation of IL-1β."
Functional analysis of a dietary recombinant fatty acid binding protein 10 (FABP10) on the Epinephelus coioides in response to acute low temperature challenge,24412164,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24412164,"The effect of Ec-FABP10 (Epinephelus coiodes-FABP10) on growth performance, enzyme activity, respiratory burst, MDA level, ATP content, immune-related gene expression of juvenile orange-spotted grouper (E. coioides). The commercial diet supplemented with FABP10 protein was feed to orange-spotted grouper for six weeks. No significant difference was observed in the specific growth rates, while the survival rate in the FABP10 additive group was significantly higher. After the feeding trial, the groupers were exposed to acute low temperature challenge. The decreased level of respiratory burst activity was observed in the FABP10 additive group after the exposure to the acute low temperature stress, while the blood cell count increased significantly at 15 °C and a significant increase of ATP content was observed at 10 °C. Higher enzymatic activities of CAT and SOD were observed at 20 °C and 15 °C, respectively. Meanwhile, the lower level of MDA was observed after the exposure to acute low temperature challenge by comparing with the controls. Further transcript expression analyses of FABP10, SOD2, GPX4, HSPA4 and LIPC in liver by quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that the up-regulated transcript expression of FABP10, SOD2, HSPA4 and LIPC was observed in FABP10 additive group at 15 °C, while the transcript expression of GPX4 increased significantly at 20 °C. Western blotting analysis confirmed that FABP10 protein expression strongly increased at 15 ± 0.5 °C in FABP10 additive group. These results showed that FABP10 additive diet could moderate the metabolic and immune abilities mainly via ROS pathway in the orange-spotted grouper."
[Expressions of HSP110 family members in the testes and epididymis of mice at different stages of development and their regulation by hormones],31640949,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31640949,"Objective:
        

      
      To study the expressions of the members of HSP110 family in the testis and epididymis of mice at different stages of development and whether they are regulated by hormones.
    





          Methods:
        

      
      The testicular and epididymis tissues of mice at different ages (14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 70, and 90 days after birth, 3 mice at each age) were collected for RT-PCR detection of the expression levels of HSP110 family members. Forty-eight mice were randomized into 3 groups for sham operation, castration, or castration with testosterone injections every other day (starting at 7 days after castration), and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after first testosterone injection, the expressions of HSP110 family in the epididymis were detected using RT-PCR.
    





          Results:
        

      
      The mRNA expression levels of HSP110 family members underwent obvious variations with the development of the mice: 
HSPA4
, 
HSPA4l
 and 
HSPH1
 expressions in the testicles of the mice first increased and then decreased, and gradually became stable; they also exhibited similar temporal patterns of changes in the epididymis. In the castrated mice, the mRNA expressions of

 are under the regulation by hormones."
Cerebral activation and distribution of inducible hsp110 and hsp70 mRNAs following focal ischemia in rat,11567777,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11567777,"A potential function for inducible heat shock protein 70 (hsp70i) expression in the pathophysiology of ischemic brain has been well documented. The recently cloned hsp70 superfamily member, hsp110, was shown to be highly expressed in the brain and suggested to have a similar functional property as members of the hsp70 family. In this study, as an initial step to probe for its physiological significance in the ischemic brain, cerebral activation and distribution of hsp110 mRNA was comparatively evaluated with that of hsp70i mRNA by in situ hybridization. A rat focal cerebral ischemia model was employed to examine the distribution and localization of hsp110 and hsp70i mRNAs in both affected (ipsilateral) and unaffected (contralateral) hemispheres of the same animal. Our results demonstrated a significant accumulation of hsp110 as well as hsp70i mRNAs following ischemia; although the magnitude and kinetics of induction differ slightly, spatial expression profiles of hsp110 and hsp70i mRNAs were highly correlated in the affected region. In control brain, limited hybridization signal was observed with 3'-untranslated region (UTR) containing hsp110 probe, suggesting a possible existence of inducible hsp110 and a selective recognition of our 3'-UTR containing probe for the inducible hsp110 mRNA species. Subsequent 2D western analysis with Hsp110 specific Ab was consistent with our view, which resolved constitutive and inducible immunostained spots in rat ischemic brain. Considering a regulatory similarity as well as previously documented structural and functional similarities between hsp110 and hsp70i, we propose that coordinated cerebral activation of hsp110 and hsp70i is likely to be of significant relevance in the context of pathophysiology of ischemic brain. Further study is required to characterize the genetic and biochemical nature of rat inducible hsp110 identified in the current study."
Effects of a Dissostichus mawsoni-CaM recombinant proteins feed additive on the juvenile orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) under the acute low temperature challenge,26122279,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26122279,"The effects of Dissostichus mawsoni-Calmodulin (Dm-CaM) on growth performance, enzyme activities, respiratory burst, MDA level and immune-related gene expressions of the orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) exposed to the acute low temperature stress were evaluated. The commercial diet supplemented with Dm-CaM protein was fed to the groupers for 6 weeks. No significant difference was observed in the specific growth rates, weight gains and survivals. After the feeding trial, the groupers were exposed to acute low temperature challenge. The groupers fed with Dm-CaM additive diet showed a significant decrease in the respiratory burst activity, while the blood cell number increased significantly at 25 °C by comparing with the control and additive control group. The enzymatic activity of SOD, ACP and ALP increased significantly in Dm-CaM additive group, while MDA level maintained stable with the lowest value. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the up-regulated transcript expressions of CaM, C3, SOD2, LysC and HSPA4 were observed in Dm-CaM additive group. These results indicated that Dm-CaM additive diet may regulate the grouper immune response to the acute low temperature challenge."
Human esophageal microvascular endothelial cells respond to acidic pH stress by PI3K/AKT and p38 MAPK-regulated induction of Hsp70 and Hsp27,16790501,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16790501,"The heat shock response maintains cellular homeostasis following sublethal injury. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are induced by thermal, oxyradical, and inflammatory stress, and they chaperone denatured intracellular proteins. Hsps also chaperone signal transduction proteins, modulating signaling cascades during repeated stress. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects 7% of the US population, and it is linked to prolonged esophageal acid exposure. GERD is characterized by enhanced and selective leukocyte recruitment from esophageal microvasculature, implying activation of microvascular endothelium. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK regulate Hsp induction in primary cultures of human esophageal microvascular endothelial cells (HEMEC) in response to acid exposure (pH 4.5). Inhibitors of signaling pathways were used to define the contribution of PI3K/Akt and MAPKs in the heat shock response and following acid exposure. Acid significantly enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and MAPKs in HEMEC as well as inducing Hsp27 and Hsp70. The PI3K inhibitor LY-294002, and Akt small interfering RNA inhibited Akt activation and Hsp70 expression in HEMEC. The p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB-203580) and p38 MAPK siRNA blocked Hsp27 and Hsp70 mRNA induction, suggesting a role for MAPKs in the HEMEC heat shock response. Thus acidic pH exposure protects HEMEC through induction of Hsps and activation of MAPK and PI3 kinase pathway. Acidic exposure increased HEMEC expression of VCAM-1 protein, but not ICAM-1, which may contribute to selective leukocyte (i.e., eosinophil) recruitment in esophagitis. Activation of esophageal endothelial cells exposed to acidic refluxate may contribute to GERD in the setting of a disturbed mucosal squamous epithelial barrier (i.e., erosive esophagitis, peptic ulceration)."
Immunocytochemical investigations of heat shock proteins expression during thymic apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids,10707369,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10707369,"The aim of our study was to investigate a possible expression of different HSPs in rat's thymuses after hydrocortisone administration. The thymuses of 41 young rats (25 to 45 days age old) were studied immunocytochemically: 12 rats were not injected, 8 received an injection of physiological serum, and 21 received HC (125 mg/kg). HSP27, 70 and 110 expression was investigated following the PAP method. HSPs27 were expressed neither in normal thymic lobules nor in the cortical thymic cells after HC injection. HSPs70 were objectivated only in 1 control animal, but were frankly expressed in cortical thymic cells 1 to 48 hours after HC injection and remained significantly expressed until the 7th day after HC injection. HSPs 110 were present in only 1 control animal and appeared to be distinctly expressed 48 hours after HC injection. HSPs 70 and 110 were never expressed in the regenerated thymuses 14 and 21 days after HC injection. This report objectivates for the first time 70 and 110 kDa ""stress proteins"" expression during the thymic apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids."
Association of Met439Thr substitution in heat shock protein 70 gene with postoperative atrial fibrillation and serum HSP70 protein levels,17934269,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17934269,"Background:
        

      
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia encountered following cardiac surgery. Previously, we have shown that higher expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 was associated with decreased incidence of postoperative AF (PoAF), suggestive of an antiarrhythmic role.
    





          Objective:
        

      
      We have hypothesised that Met493Thr substitution of one of the important hsp70 genes may cause loss of these protective antiarrhythmic effects. We therefore set out to examine the influence of hsp70 genotype on the incidence of PoAF.
    





          Methods and results:
        

      
      We prospectively recruited 244 Caucasian patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery. The median age was 65 years (40-80 years). PoAF was defined as the characteristic arrhythmia lasting for at least 15 min, occurring within first week following surgery and requiring treatment. This occurred in 48 patients (19.7%). Validated Met493Thr substitution in hsp70-Hom was determined using established techniques. Of 244 patients, genotype was determined for 242 cases. The three genotypes (MM, MT, and TT) were present at frequencies of 0.66, 0.31, and 0.03, respectively, and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In unifactorial analysis patients carrier or homozygous for 493Thr mutation had significantly higher incidence of PoAF (Pearson chi(2) = 4.3, p = 0.037). Multivariate analysis confirmed the positive association of hsp70-Hom with PoAF (OR, 2.43; p = 0.016) independent of age, sex, previous myocardial infarction, number of distal anastomoses, and duration of ventilation, respectively. Serum HSP70 was ranging from 0.74 to 31.91 ng/ml (median, 2.89) and was not correlated with PoAF. Presence of 493Thr mutation was also significantly correlated with higher levels of serum HSP70 (p = 0.009).
    





          Conclusions:
        

      
      Our data show that a mutation in hsp70-Hom gene is associated with higher incidence of PoAF. These findings are consistent with our previous results and may suggest that patients harbouring this substitution will have less endogenous myocardial protection against AF in stressful situations."
"Molecular cloning of a novel member of the HSP110 family of genes, ischemia-responsive protein 94 kDa (irp94), expressed in rat brain after transient forebrain ischemia",10098860,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10098860,"To identify genes induced by transient forebrain ischemia, we used the mRNA differential display technique in the four-vessel occlusion model in rats. Some genes were identified as candidates that encode ischemia-responsive protein, and one of them was cloned as ischemia-responsive protein 94 kDa (irp94) from the rat hippocampal cDNA library. Sequence analysis suggested that rat irp94 was a transcriptional variant or a homologue of mouse apg-2 and human heat shock protein (hsp) 70RY and a member of the HSP110 family, because IRP94 was >90% identical to APG-2 and HSP70RY and approximately 60% identical to the other members of the HSP110 family. Although irp94 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the normal hippocampus, it was clearly enhanced 4-24 h after ischemia for 10 (1.9-fold increase) and 15 min (3.4-fold increase). These changes mainly occurred in neuronal cells, as judged by the localization of irp94 mRNA using in situ hybridization histochemistry. On the other hand, hyperthermic stress did not enhance irp94 mRNA expression, suggesting that irp94 expression was enhanced under ischemic stress and not related to the heat shock signaling mechanism. Our study suggested that irp94, a novel member of the HSP110 family, might play an important role in the environment altering neuronal functions, especially after transient forebrain ischemia."
An immunohistochemical study of APG-2 protein in the rat hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia,11750909,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11750909,"The cellular localization and spatiotemporal expression pattern of APG-2 protein, a member of the heat shock protein 110 family, were investigated in the rat hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia. The spatiotemporal patterns of immunoreactivity of both APG-2 and glial fibrillary acidic protein were very similar, indicating that reactive astrocytes express APG-2, which was confirmed by double immunofluorescence histochemistry. Colocalization of APG-2 and a neuronal marker NeuN in the neurons of the CA2 and CA3 subfields was also confirmed."
"ERK1/2 phosphorylation, induced by electromagnetic fields, diminishes during neoplastic transformation",10861836,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10861836,"It has been suggested that electromagnetic (EM) fields can act as co-promoters during neoplastic transformation. To examine this possibility, we studied the effects of 0.8-, 8-, 80-, and 300-microT 60-Hz electromagnetic (EM) fields in INITC3H/10T1/2 mouse fibroblast cells. These cells are transformed carcinogenically by methylcholanthrene, but the neoplastic phenotype can be suppressed indefinitely by the presence of retinyl acetate (RAC) in the culture medium. The effects of EM field exposures were examined at three stages: (1) before initiation of transformation (i.e., RAC in the culture media); (2) early in the transformation process (4 days after withdrawal of RAC); and (3) at full of neoplastic transformation (10 days after withdrawal of RAC). EM field exposures induced significant increases in protein levels for hsp70 and c-Fos and in AP-1 binding activity. EM fields induced phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK1/2 before the onset of transformation, but these increases diminished during the transformation process. No phosphorylation in the other major extracellular stress pathway, SAPK/JNK, was detected in cells exposed to EM fields at any time before, during, or after neoplastic transformation. Human cells HL60, MCF7, and HTB124, exposed to EM fields, also showed MAPK/ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Cells treated with the phorbol ester, TPA, served as positive controls for AP-1 activation, c-Fos protein synthesis, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. There was no indication that EM fields affected the rate of cell transformation or acted as a co-promoter, under the conditions of this study."
Hsp70RY: further characterization of a novel member of the hsp70 protein family,8074706,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8074706,"Hsp70RY was identified as a member of the hsp70 protein family on the basis of cDNA sequence homology (Fathallah, et. al. (1993) J. Immunol. 151, 810-813). We have shown that mRNA encoding hsp70RY is expressed in a variety of human cell lines and that mRNA expression remains unchanged in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells induced to differentiate with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). We have also shown that the predicted amino acid sequence of hsp70RY diverges significantly from the other human hsp70 proteins and that it contains a unique glutamate-rich region near its carboxy-terminus. Finally, we have demonstrated the existence of a murine homolog of hsp70RY."
Cleavage at the carboxyl-terminus of Ku80 during apoptosis in human Jurkat T cells,16002990,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16002990,"We have previously reported that the amount of Apg-2, an Hsp110 family protein, decreases during apoptosis in Jurkat T cells. Since we hypothesized that Apg-2 would be cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis, a cleavage-site-directed antibody was raised against the carboxyl-terminus of the Apg-2 fragment that appears after the cleavage by caspase-3. Although this antibody could not detect the Apg-2 fragment in apoptotic cells, three additional fragments were unexpectedly detected. Based on the results of microsequencing, one of these fragments was identified as Ku80. Ku80 is a nuclear protein and a component of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). In this study, we observed that Ku80 is cleaved at Asp-730 residue during apoptosis, and this cleavage occurs in the nucleus in the early apoptotic phase. Furthermore, Ku80 is distributed in the cytoplasm of nuclear fragmented apoptotic cells, although the cleaved fragment contains the nuclear-localization signal (NLS). Our study clearly shows that Ku80 is cleaved in the nucleus, and distributes in the cytoplasm during apoptosis."
